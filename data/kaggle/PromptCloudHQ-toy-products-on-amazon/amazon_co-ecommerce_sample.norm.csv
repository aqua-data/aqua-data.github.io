 on 6 April 2014 // Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy  the new Hornby catalogue every year, even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By

But it's very much alike to a 00 gauge.

 on 26 May 2015 // Simple & GREAT FUN for 5+My nephews face was amazing when he opened this for his birthday!! His mouth dropped open with surprise! It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains.

 on 13 Nov. 2011 // My 2 year old loves chuggington so we decided to get her this set. To be fair i dont think there is much longevity with it and after a while my daughter played with the train itself rather than the train and track although it does still come out now and again. I had read some reviews that you have to keep building the track as it comes apart easily. I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not, i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way, but time will cure that. Overall yes im glad i got it for her and i dont regret buying it, there are better products out there or might be just worth getting them the trains on there own. | Excellent entertainment set // 5.0 // 11 Feb. 2014 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 12 Mar. 2014 // This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a white enclosed coach, with a pair of white horses, and two figures on the  driving seat dressed in a grey livery. One is a man in a grey greatcoat and top hat, the other is a female in a grey coat or uniform jacket and grey jockey-style of cap. There do not appear to be figures inside, but if you look through the back window, these are heads visible. This is a striking model, and would be an excellent decoration for almost any diorama.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £20 for my set, so it pays to shop around in your local model shops - or even a distant one.

 on 26 Feb. 2013 // Have to say that this is a lovely item,if a tad expensive,but still a little gem.I managed to get mine at a bargain price,but if you can too then it is well worth having.My biggest incentive in buying this was to be able to add two extra wooden/teak ex-LNER coaches to the three I already have from the Rare Bird set from the Barry J Freeman range.Those three teaks are very difficult to add to,due to most coaches being LNER & not BR.This set means you can have a rake of five!The detail on them is utterly sublime & they are stunning,a tenfold better than the teaks in the railroad range.If only they made a BR-numbered buffet car!As for the lovely black British Railways N2 tank loco-well that too is a lovely item,great little runner & puller.Only drawback is that the locomotive is not digitally/DCC ready as far as I gather.Not VFM if you consider how much is being outlaid.It comes with a numbered certificate & very attractively decorative box......I give it an eight out of ten,with marks lost on cost & the lack of an easy to fit DCC socket... | An excellent model in Pristine finish! // 4.0 // 4 Feb. 2013 // By

The locomotive is DCC-ready. As with all Hornby starter sets, there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy - they don't seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing, but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight, and it all slots together easily. There is also a ""trackmat"" supplied, which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout, to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories - more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat - you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse, but it's all you need to get started. Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so - it's reasonably obvious how you assemble it all, which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem, as most bits will only fit one way!Read more › | The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it // 4.0 // 3 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 3 Dec. 2015 // A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it, and for a ""railroad"" model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at, and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included, while a fairly minimal amount, is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger, it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly, and I can't wait to see it running on a much larger layout! | Good starter for the enthusiast // 5.0 // 1 Dec. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 14 Oct. 2014 // This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras, to get the best out of it. As a starting point, it's great though.The track is good-quality but does need a flat, solid base. You'll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm ""MidiMat"" too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages, with their white `table cloths' and gold-coloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it, as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A  are included, to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C  gives you a double oval with siding . D and E  make it really interesting, but that's almost £100, so far, and you can still add F  for extra sidings. Oh, and you'll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat, R8217, to go with packs E and F.Then you'll want to add accessories such as stations, signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...don't imagine £150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track, the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for 'fun'.Some parts, notably some of the couplings, seem rather fragile. I wouldn't recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum, and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more › | A good starter set. // 4.0 // 19 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 19 Jan. 2015 // This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models. It is a pity that the roofs are silver and a bit ""flashy"", they would have been better in grey. Another slight inconvenience is that the couplings do not match. The loco has the newer style couplings and the coaches the wider older style but this does not impede hooking up however. This train set was a real bargain at the price I paid at the time.",""

 on 20 Nov. 2013 // I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages .It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it . The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed .When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit  you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it . I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces  after using this set. | Excellent introduction  to the hobby. // 5.0 // 26 Oct. 2014 // By

VINE VOICE on 26 Oct. 2014 // Every child should own a train set, and lately I've started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too, so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. .It's nice to see, after not handling  a set since the early 70s, that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel, lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service, with both passenger and freight carriages, but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It's very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game, and the price is what it is: They've always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally, whereas this is on an old style analogue controller, which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains, etc, this  set would have to run on a separate track?So, I'm really glad i own a trainset again, and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump. | Great starter set, but do your research // 4.0 // 3 Jan. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 3 Jan. 2015 // My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops, museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before, but it is clearly well thought out, very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was, it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge, but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set, it can be oval or circular and that's about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics, but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy, very classic, but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It's huge, to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example, but to go up you need to slope very very gradually, otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn't climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space, and once you accept it won't slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle , as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more ›",""

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 30 Jun. 2014 // This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Saxon Sate Railways  1st/2nd class express bogie coach - type ABBu - in the standard epoch 1 dark green livery, with a light grey roof. This is a very modern style of wooden-framed steel panelled side-corridor coach, with a steel chassis, and end-vestibule entrances and `concertina' connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows, such as the partitions and seating, and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is 103.This model is fitted with the standard `loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Piko card box with a transparent window, and a transparent plastic side-opening tray inside.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture, with a small packet of delicate bits for you to add. There are other models available to form a rake of these coaches.Note that I paid £37 for my model when new, so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth hopping on a train to Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.",""

 on 30 Dec. 2013 // I have recently decided to rebuild my model railway after many years being stored in a box.  I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didn't take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed, even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it. | This is not a toy! // 4.0 // 3 Feb. 2013 // By

 on 21 May 2015 // Easy to install, either by slotting directly into OO gauge track or by joining wires to holes in the base plate of the signal. Easy to set-up, just assign 2x 2 digit accessory addresses from your DCC controller  and its ready to use. Full instructions included along with a ladder & sign plate to add even more realism if you so wish.  I have the Hornby E-link & Railmaster system and these work perfectly with it. Other types of signal are also available with single heads, distant & Home types. The real benefit of these signals is that because they are wire-free you can move them on your lay-out quickly if you change your mind or layout, so worth the extra cost compared with regular signals. plus they are LED for a long life. | Easy bit with placement limitations // 3.0 // 12 Oct. 2015 // By

 on 8 Oct. 2015 // Good little train set, something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane, which you can get in a 'steam era' rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side . Of course, that doesn't match with steam train ; but this being a beginners train set that won't matter most young children . The crane is weighted so it won't tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme, like a general shunting train, as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this, but it's low priced so it stays at 5.The controller, track, wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset, especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round..... | Great set // 5.0 // 16 April 2015 // By

 on 8 Jan. 2016 // Nice starter set - has the standard basic oval and Track Pack one track, and a midi mat. The mat is paper, so not really durable for using over and over again unless you build a baseboard.The locomotive is a little under powered for the wagons - you need to be quite gentle setting off to prevent slipping, and the crane is quite hard to position on the rails, so maybe not the best for younger children who might get frustrated with.The detail on the engine is quite basic - if you like realism a bit of weathering may be good to make it look a bit better. The crane is lovely and nicely detailed. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 9 Dec. 2015 // By

Detail is not what would be expected these days - the heavily applied boiler bands and handrails  detract from an otherwise accurate kit . These faults can , however , be rectified with care and despite this , the basic kit has been the basis over the years for countless , motorised , working  models . Not only can the kit be used to build a GWR 'City' class loco but determined 'kitbashers' can use it as the basis for several broadly similar GWR classes from the early years of the twentieth century .

 on 27 Feb. 2015 // Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators  the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don't agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in.  Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point, with the windows correctly in place, the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body . The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers, then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn't lift and drop as freely as it should now. It's on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order  that I've docked a star.",""

It is really well packaged, comes in its corgi box. Inside this box is a hardened case and the train is secured in it. The attention to detail is fantastic. It is in perfect condition and I am sure that this will make a lovely addition to anyone's collection. I really like the stories behind these trains and choosing of the name.

 on 8 Aug. 2014 // These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars, built in the 1930's, survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries, crimson and cream, maroon  and finally the blue and grey depicted here used from the mid-1960's.  I've given this one 5* as opposed to the maroon one's 4* as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery.  The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating.  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. It's stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E, whilst the one depicted here, E9131E, lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and, whilst a scale person wouldn't fit into the gap between the seats and tables, you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. It's a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging, an  transparent sandwich display case, what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though, presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches, over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.There's also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions  in the beers department.Read more › | Five Stars // 5.0 // 5 Mar. 2015 // By

 on 24 Aug. 2010 // The interactive Chuggington is a brilliant idea. However I was left a little dissapointed. I was under the impression each chugger interacted with each other automatically. This is not so, you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell, chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition. I know as my child gets older he will develop his play but I feel a little mis-led by the concept. I have also had to return the action chugger as the paint on the wings was peeling. I have asked for a replacement however as action chugger is the main man in our household! Enjoy! | Wheels to the rails! // 4.0 // 22 April 2011 // By

 on 22 April 2011 // My 3 year old son loves his talking trains - they are in his top 3 toys. We initially bought him Koko and Wilson for Christmas but could not find a Brewster to go with them, so promised him one for his birthday, then we got him the Brewster with track and tunnel set. I have to say he gets more pleasure from the trains than the tracks, which are rather fiddly to set up  and he doesn't seem to have grasped that you have to raise the drawbridge with the little lever - if you raise it by hand, it tends to lift off the tracks so I'm constantly having to help him put it back. He also keeps switching the tunnel off for some reason. However, the toys are very sturdy, the trains in particular have been subjected to a certain amount of bashing but have withstood all ill treatment .The trains are beautifully made - bright, sturdy, cheerful and just like their TV counterparts, with nice clear voices which are also individually distinctive. They prompt imaginative, interactive play - he talks to them and makes up stories for them, and we have to stop him taking them to bed with him otherwise he would stay up all night chatting! There seems to be quite a wide range of comments between the trains, although disappointingly, only a couple of responses to the tunnel and drawbridge. The trains respond over quite a large distance, for example he has left one on the stairs and you could hear it joining in while he played with the others in the living room, so I would say at least within hearing range. Of course now he wants the Chugwash  so further sets & trains will have to be added in future...Read more › | My son loves this // 5.0 // 28 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 28 Dec. 2010 // I bought this for my 3 year old son for christmas and he hasn't stopped playing with it, for a last minute purchase it has turned out to be the best.  He loves it so much i've just bought the straigh& curved track and the extra level track to make it even more enjoyable... what i love most about this is that you can buy so many things to add on, so for easter i'll get him more for the track so he'll never get bored.I along with the othe person's review thought the trains would automatically interact with each other but my son is getting used to pressing the buttons more now so it's not so bad, i think for a younger child they wouldn't get as much fun from the interactive part.On the whole I would definately recommend this product... have fun chugging everyone xxx | What an excellent toy // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By

 on 24 Oct. 2010 // It's ok, just a train to push around, doesn't go on it's own. Only has a couple of phrases on it's own. I only have 2 interactive trains, they say a few things to each other but not a lot. You would need everthing for it to say as much as it can! To be honest, my son would have been happy if it didn't say anything at all. He played with them when I first got them and now they don't get out of the toy box much, but that's just kids! | Very clever little toys // 5.0 // 14 Dec. 2010 // By

Most times it seems to be a different phrase but I can imagine the kids having loads of fun as I believe they will interact with the track itsself as well.Got them on special offer with Amazon, would work out fairly expensive paying full price for them all but for a fiver each, SUPER!!! | Foreign koko // 1.0 // 3 Jan. 2012 // By

I bought 3 different sets to build a larger layout, and not a hand in site on any of the pictures !Quality of the track and engines and extras very good, but the technology to make them move is not new , and would have been so simple and easy to install as they need batteries anyway. | let's interact.... but only if you push the button!! // 4.0 // 24 Aug. 2010 // By

 on 15 April 2015 // A very good train set and very popular with the young infants in my family .  The range of layouts that you can build is good and the pieces are easy to assemble even for little ones.  Both trains run well in the tracks.  The wood is a good fine grain that does not splinter easily, and is well finished, so is safe for children to handle.  It is also quite robust.  A couple of minor issues.  The track supports for the elevated section are rather too narrow and can fall over easily.  If they were a square section they would be more stable and support the elevated pieces much better.  This can be remedied by cutting duplicate supports and glueing them together to make the square cross section.  Also a couple of extra pieces to act as joining pieces would help add yet more variety to the layout designs.  One that is needed is another double hole joint and the other a double plug connector.  Nevertheless overall it is a highly recommended product that can keep youngsters safely occupied for hours.  But for these minor failings I would have given it 5 stars. | Good set for the price. // 4.0 // 26 May 2014 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 31 May 2014 // This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways  baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery, with a grey-green roof. It is a short four-wheeled vehicle with smooth flat sides, and two end platforms. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows. The running number is Munchen PpostL 21029.This model is fitted with the standard 'loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with the usual transparent plasticky internal packaging, but with only a base and two folding-up end-pieces, no top.This is a beautifully detailed model, as you would expect from Trix, with some fine details already in place, but there is a packet of delicate bits for you to add. It is of a high quality of manufacture.Note that I paid £32 for my model, so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one.",""

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 22 Mar. 2014 // This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a long wooden wagon with a seated driver and various sacks inside, and with two horses hauling it. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model, and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £14 for my set, so it pays to shop around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.",""

Completed in 2008, Tornado was the first such locomotive built in the United Kingdom since Evening Star, the last steam locomotive built by British Railways, in 1960. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards, Tornado runs on the UK rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.The locomotive was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, a charitable trust founded in 1990 to build Tornado and possibly further locomotives. Tornado was conceived as an evolution of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 class, incorporating improvements likely had steam continued, and changes for cost, safety, manufacturing and operational benefits, while replicating the original design's sound and appearance. Tornado, completely new-built, is considered the 50th Peppercorn A1, numbered next in the class after 60162, Saint Johnstoun, built in 1949.Tornado moved under her own power for the first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington, and then spent two months at the preserved Great Central Railway double-track tourist railway in Loughborough, where she was tested up to 60 mph  and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum  in York for three test runs on the main line up to 75 mph . After repainting into LNER Apple Green, Tornado was approved for main-line passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line, The Peppercorn Pioneer, from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours, charters and other activities, Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated £800,000 debt from the project, which cost around £3 million.The new Hornby model is represented in the familiar Apple Green of the early British Railways colour scheme.Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC  layout. This loco is 'DCC Ready', meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder. Once this decoder is fitted it is ready to use on a DCC layout.

VINE VOICE on 6 Oct. 2013 // This is a really nice looking model train.It is DCC ready and in the oo gauge scale.The details are really nice and I just love the colour of this model train.I have wanted this for a long time and I am not disappointed by it at all.My ratings of this model train are 5 star for fun as when this is on anyone's track it will not disappoint in the fun it will bring you.The educational value I have left blank as I don't really think that there is any educational value to this as its there to be looked at or used on a model railway track to be an addition to a collection of your model railway.The durable rating is 4 star as it feels nicely made and solid however I am sure if its dropped from a height then it would most probably cause damage and finally the overall rating is a 5 star as its a beautiful addition to any model railway.Highly recommended to any model train enthusiast or simply as a decorate model to just look at either way I am sure you would love this train. | and the best thing about Hornby Railroad series models you can upgrade ... // 5.0 // 30 Aug. 2014 // By

 on 30 April 2011 // I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play, without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He get's so excited everytime he gets a new engine, as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas, Spencer, Percy, Diesel, Toby,and some other's. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.It's great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tender's. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys I've seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines, making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him, and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment, I wish it was made plain in Amazon's product details which ones talk and don't. Which are die cast etc, I find myself sometimes going through products for an age, or going to other sites, to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and I'm always pleased with the service, but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier.

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 16 Sept. 2014 // At £50 this is a bargain and a really good set to start off a model train hobby. My 5 year old was desperate to have his own proper train set and I was concerned over getting one of the >£100 sets so this fit the bill. The track mat is a great idea and didn't take long to assemble it all.My only problem was with the controller. Everytime there was a derailment, the controller would stop working for about 1 minute, one of it's safety features. I gave up with it in the end and got a better one off the Internet. | MY NEPHEW LOVES IT // 4.0 // 9 Aug. 2013 // By

The first electric all-Pullman service in the world, it ran from 29 June 1934 till 30 April 1972.The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway was also the origin of the familiar British umber and cream Pullman livery. In 1903 Billinton changed the colour of the ordinary L.B. & S.C.R. coaches to umber brown with white or cream upper panels, and in 1906 this colour scheme was also adopted by the Pullman Car Co., with the name of the car in large gilt letters on the lower panel and flanked on each side by a coloured transfer of the Pullman Company's crest.Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the Southern Belle. Contemporary advertising by the L.B. & S.C.R. claimed that this was ""... the most luxurious train in the world..."". In 1908 this could be experienced for a special London Victoria to Brighton day return fare of 12 shillings, a premium rate at a time when average earnings were around £1 a week. The Southern Belle was steam hauled until 1933, when electric units were introduced. With the arrival of the mid-day Victoria to Brighton service at Brighton Station on 29 June 1934, the Mayor of Brighton, Miss M.

 on 13 April 2013 // This a really accurate model of the Brighton Belle as it first appeared in 1932. It's detail correct up until about 1952 when new bogies were used to help improve the ride and the second class Pullmans changed their logo to simply ""Car No.88"" etc.I have bought the full 5 car set using matching coaches also made by Hornby. The Hornby list price is right for what you get but my budget doesn't go that far so I've shopped around and found absolute bargains both on amazon and ebay sites as sellers discount their stock to get a quick sale.The train itself runs very well and although there is only one power bogie it is more than adequate to pull the whole 5 car train up the 1 in 30 inclines on my layout.The chassis is made of metal which gives extra adhesion but the real key to this is how Hornby have arranged the power collection for the lighting to run from the power car itself through the couplings to all the cars rather than collect it from each of the carriages' bogies. This way there is no additional friction at all from pick-ups which might reduce power.It runs perfectly well in either direction even though the power bogie is in one of the end driving cars.Well done Hornby and well done amazon for providing the market place where sellers can provide the discount I need.",""

    Miss Kelly
  
 on 18 April 2012 // I bought this for my 3 year old son who is obsessed with Thomas and the Trackmaster collection. He absolutly loves the day of the diesels film, so I got him this train, along with Den, Dart and Bell. Its still great fun like all previous trackmaster trains, and is fantastic for any child who loves playing with trains. I think its great for developing imaginative play too, as he now makes the ""diesels"" and ""steamies"" role play and talk, and we've painted an old box to make a diesel works. He absolutly loves diesel 10 and takes him everywhere. The only criticism I would have is that he requires a C cell battery, which I have to replace every 2-3 days, but this is probably because my son literally plays with him from the moment he gets up to the time he goes to bed! | Not fit for purpose! // 1.0 // 29 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 29 Dec. 2012 // TrackMaster should redesign this toy.  I gave it to my grandson on Christmas Day.  He had been asking to have a Diesel 10 for months and was so pleased when he opened it.  The battery does not stay in place.  Any jolt or movement dislodges the battery which has only the metal connections to each end holding it in a large space.  We tried packing it with card but in the end playdough all round the battery filling the cavity held it in place so he could play with it.It is so disappointing for children when new toys don't work.  This is not the only Thomas engine that needs better design. | Another happy Thomas purchase! // 5.0 // 9 Feb. 2012 // By

 on 10 Jan. 2014 // Ok...the engine itself is well made and should last. But, it's damned expensive for what it is.I would also note that the ""grabber"" is fixed with only the jaws opening. True, a fully mobile grabber would last around 2 hours with the average small boy but I would just take note in case it's expected.The lad loves it though so minor quibbles only... | Not really a 'play set' // 5.0 // 14 Jun. 2012 // By

 on 14 Jun. 2012 // Our son loves the Thomas Trackmaster trains and track. Luckily he already has a couple of sets as this 'playset' is just a train.It does say what is included in the details to be fair, but I still think the product name is misleading.I can't fault the train though, other than the claw arm being fixed in place. Its the first thing our lad tried to move! | Great toy for Thomas fans // 5.0 // 20 May 2013 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 14 July 2014 // This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways  3rd class express bogie coach - type CCu - in the standard epoch 1 lined green livery, with a black roof. This is a very modern style of side-corridor coach, with end-vestibule entrances and 'concertina' connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows, such as the partitions and seating , and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is CCu 13017, and the destination board is for a Munich to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard 'loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches, along with a baggage car.",""

The Southern Railway  was established in 1923, linking London with the Channel ports, South West England, South coast resorts in Kent. It was the smallest of the 'Big Four' railway regions with most of it's revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous 'named' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry , Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world's largest electrified railway system. The steel panelled wooden framed bodied were built at SR Eastleigh Works and the steel underframes at SR Lancing Works. Each 2 car unit measured 129ft 6in long and 9ft 2in, wide and were powered by two English Electric traction motors of 275hp  with a maximum speed of 60mph. The units were fitted with automatic air-brakes The 2-BILs weighed 74tons 15cwt and had a passenger capacity of 24 in the First Class and 84 or 88 Third Class area. The remaining units stayed in service and passed to the newly formed British Railways in 1948 where they were re-classified as Class 401 and continued in service on BR Southern Region but by 1971 all the units have been withdrawn.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959.

#1 HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 24 Oct. 2013 // This product is designed as a scale model for adult collectors - it is not a toy for children and the Amazon category should reflect that.However, turning to the actual product - the Sir Nigel Gresley, A4 Pacific Class Locomotive model which is supplied with tender - it is a nicely presented scale model which is highly detailed in terms of paintwork, wheels, pistons and piping etc.  The amount of work that must have gone into producing this model is significant and it has resulted in a good quality model, especially in view of the price. I think the finish is very good although it is a static model eg. the wheels etc. do not rotate and it is fixed to its stand which is effectively a short length of track. The real locomotive is preserved by the North Yorks Moors Railway and this replica certainly does justice to it.The model is supplied in an outer sleeve which protects a clear plastic case, in the case of my model it also has a removable thin plastic film over part of it as an additional protection. At the price you couldn't really ask for more, and, if like me, you are short of space, the 1:120 scale is ideal. Recommended. | Loved this product // 5.0 // 13 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said, I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money , the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal! | LNER'S Flying Scotsman. // 4.0 // 3 Nov. 2012 // By

 on 3 Nov. 2012 // This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set, I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches, oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches, oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A,B,C and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set, and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail, you can see into the windows, each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments  and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one, and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost, I would not let young children play with it on their own, but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By
    
    Dr Rick
  
 on 24 Nov. 2013 // Especially as discounted by Amazon, this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. I'd classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner's set in that the detailing isn't as fine as Hornby's more expensive models, or of some of the others in the market, e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality, but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldn't use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard, and without one you'll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; it's held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set it's already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy. It's really disappointing to find that it's many good qualities are ruined by a small but crucial element that renders it quickly useless. | Better than expected // 5.0 // 26 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 26 Dec. 2012 // Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat, we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly, the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described . This on top of the high quality track, carriages and engine, it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on! | Boyhood dream fulfilled - after fifty years!

VINE VOICE on 11 Jan. 2015 // I had small clock-work train sets and, eventually progressed to a small electric train-set with a circular track - the train did smoke  but mum was wary of letting me play with it alone and, in any case it only went round in circles. I am now the proud owner of the Flying Scotsman from the famous Hornby and this particular  little boy is like a dog with two tails . What a wonderful set, designed as a complete starter set with mat, track etc etc.This quality product is very possibly going to be the start of something big, very big. It would make a dream gift for any boy OR girl  by a maker that you can trust - and you get an iconic engine as well with its wonderful colour and memories of times past.....",""

From 1953 to 1962, 996 locomotives were produced, making it the most numerous of all British locomotive classes. As the standard general-purpose diesel shunter on BR, almost any duty requiring shunting would involve a Class 08. The class became a familiar sight at many major stations and freight yards. However, since their introduction, the nature of rail traffic in Britain has changed considerably. Freight trains are now mostly fixed rakes of wagons and passenger trains are mostly multiple units, neither requiring the attention of a shunting locomotive. Consequently, a large proportion of the class has been withdrawn from mainline use and stored, scrapped, exported or sold to industrial or heritage railways.As of 2011, around 100 locomotives remain working on industrial sidings and on the main British network. On heritage railways, they have become common, appearing on many of the preserved standard-gauge lines in Britain, with over 60 preserved.Digital control  has many advantages over the conventional DC control, however arguably the most dramatic bonus of operating DCC must be the advantages of Operating locomotives fitted with sound. How wonderfully alive can a layout become when sound can be heard from the locomotives? The more modern locomotives such as the Class 60, 56, 31 and even the ubiquitous 08, each of these classes have their own individual sound and are ready to play their part in adding audible realism to any DCC operated layout. All this is possible with Hornby Digital Sound fitted locomotives.

H. Peppercorn took advantage of Thompson's retirement in 1946 to develop the design into the K1 Class. The K1 Class, which was made up of 70 locomotives, were all built in Glasgow at the North British Locomotive Company's Park Works over a 10 month period between May 1949 and March 1950. As was the North British Locomotive Company's all of the Class were sent to Eastfield shed, Glasgow for running in before being sent to England where they were used for both freight and express passenger workings. Thirty of the Class were sent to the Eastern Region while the remaining forty were dispatched to the North Eastern Region. Many of the North Eastern K1s were often seen as far North as Edinburgh and early on in their working life were regularly used on the West Highland line. A significant number of those allocated to the Eastern Region were based at March. All of the Class were fitted with electric lighting and self-cleaning smoke boxes identified with an SC plate situated just beneath the shed plate while some were fitted with AWS . The first 50 K1 locomotives were outshopped in black with ""British Railways"" emblazoned on the tender while the remaining twenty were released with the early BR crest. From 1957 all of the Class received the BR emblem. As described the Class were used throughout the former LNER network as they were proven to be an incredible mixed traffic locomotive with each of the Class being paired with a 4200 gallon tender as used with the LNER/BR Class B1 locomotive. By 1958 the K1s were starting to be transferred from the Great Eastern Region with the result that by 1961 only eight remained at March, however by the middle of 1962 these had been moved to Retford and Doncaster. Withdrawal of the K1s began in December 1962 but it was a very slow demise as it took a full five years before the last locomotive, which was 62005 was withdrawn from service on the Eastern Region in 1967. Luckily 62005 survived into preservation and can be seen operating at the time of writing on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. K1 Class locomotive number 62059 was outshopped from the North British on the 13 December 1949. By 1950 the locomotive was on shed at 51G Haverton Hill where it remained until 1957 when 62059 could be seen on shed Ardsley and then later that year, Darlington. By March 1960 the locomotive was transferred to 51J Northallerton but was returned to Darlington in August of that same year. In February 1966, 62059 was rostered to 52F, Blyth  where it remained until withdrawal in February 1967. Locomotive BR Class K1 62059 was sold for scrap in April 1967 to Hughes Bolckow, Blyth where later that year the locomotive was cut up.

 on 17 Jan. 2016 // Bagnall industrial locomotives are hardly represented in the model market.  This delightful loco is therefore very welcome!  It adds character to a layout and runs very well - with DCS I would expect it to perform superbly.As a model, it is slightly chunky and possibly a bit taller than original - but it is running on 00 track, so the purists have much to do anyway.  It stands detailing and weathering well and can rapidly be made to look the part.  Bagnall products were characterised by endless variety about a basic design, so small departures from scale are not really an issue.The biggest compromise on looks is with the chassis - but Hornby have made the sensible decision to adopt an available, proven option.  Much improvement in looks can be acheived by installing 'skirts' to cover the wheels.  It will then much more resemble the prototype, at little cosmetic and no mechanical work.This is a great success at the ready to run stage, and forms a good base for detailing for the more advanced enthusiast.  Well done! | Five Stars // 5.0 // 6 Jan. 2016 // By

However, there isn't very much you can do with them, so the novelty wears off quite quickly and then they are more like cuddly toys that end up in bed with the kids!Not sure I would recommend buying these toys.

TOP 100 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 14 Aug. 2014 // My son is Henry Hugglemonster mad and we already have both the Henry Hugglemonster Talking Henry 25cm Soft Toy and Henry Hugglemonster Talking Summer 25cm Soft Toy soft toys but his little baby sister is always trying to swipe them from him!  I noticed this little 15cm soft toy version of Summer and thought she would be ideal for my daughter and the fact that it was on offer at just a third of it's normal price basically sealed the deal. My problem now is that I gave it to her to play with bu now my son keeps swiping Summer from his sister!My son absolutely loves the Henry Hugglemonster television show on Disney Junior and it's the one show guaranteed to make him completely stop what he's doing and gaze with rapt fascination at the television with lots of smiles and giggles every couple of minutes when Henry or Summer sings or does something funny and my daughter is also transfixed whenever the programme is on too so a bit of a Henry Hugglemonster mad household here!The toy itself is lovely and soft and despite the conflicting age recommendations in the product description  I think it is probably suitable from birth rather than 36 months as I can't see any small parts that could come off and be a danger to a baby as the eyes etc are all stitching as opposed to buttons/beads although there is no age confirmation on the label attached to the toy.Read more › | 00 it is such a good price as i have seen them in other shops ... // 5.0 // 26 Jan. 2016 // By

Loki's horns keep falling off, which is very irritating.The Hulk and Loki are very different sizes, so their accessories aren't as interchangeable as some other Mashers.

 on 7 Jun. 2012 // This was a stocking filler for a child brought up on Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler. It's a faithful representation of the illustration, and is well put together. It's worth noting the size when purchasing, however, because 7"" isn't big for a stuffed toy. Maybe this is why it hasn't got nearly as much play time as we expected. Would I buy it again? No - I'd go for something bigger, without a doubt. | Gruffalo fox // 5.0 // 25 Aug. 2012 // By

 on 17 Feb. 2015 // I don't know what is this character - just bought it for my daughter since I liked the funny look. It's a decent toy, but I don't like 2 things. First of all, the  fox can't sit. Maybe I'm the lucky guy who has this toy in such flat state, but it looks like a few elephants slept on it. Nothing changed 2 weeks later, so maybe my fox is just disabled. Second thing is the difference in colour between the tail and the rest of this creature. They are so different that it feels like the tail comes from a different fox. All in all my daughter plays with it occasionally, so this is good enough. | Top fox // 5.0 // 2 Sept. 2015 // By

TOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 15 May 2014 // Binky the Panda is one of 6 'join in and play' Blue Nose Friends. A medium sized toy, soft to the touch and very well made. If you have any problems with Binky and she won't talk then you probably haven't switched her on. There's a little on/off switch just above the battery compartment. If she still won't speak then change the batteries .Binky's interactive and will chat to the other 'join in and play' characters. Sit Binky and friends close together, press a paw or squeeze their tummy and off they go. The toys are sensitive enough they know which of their interactive friends are close by and call one another by name. Only two in the group will speak though. They don't all talk at the same time.The more toys you have in the series the more phrases they use and the longer they chat. Unfortunately, they don't say much and each one has just a short series of phrases which they repeat over and over. They also don't have any facial movement and though their voices are slightly different there's no way of telling who's saying what unless you're really close by.It's worth bearing in mind their plush fabric can't be washed because of the battery pack. You can wipe them down with a damp cloth but I really wouldn't recommend these toys for serious rough and tumble play.Incredibly cute, my granddaughter loves them, but they are limited in what they say. | Charming chatting toy panda // 5.0 // 13 July 2014 // By

 on 13 July 2014 // A delightful toy - really does have a conversation with any other Blue Nose Friend but can just be played with on it's own when it will talk to it's owner!  Not too big for little hands.  Easy to make it talk and to change the batteries.  I had one small issue when it arrived as the batteries were flat but that was soon put right and Binky ready for my grandaughter to play with. | great // 5.0 // 12 April 2014 // By

This is for my niece who is peppa pig and pirate crazy, she loves swashbuckle the programme so I thought this George in a pirate outfit would be the perfect combination for her and it went down an absolute treat with her, she insists on taking it everywhere with her which pleases me greatly as it means I have spent my money very wisely. The teddy itself is of an excellent quality which you would expect of this make, it is very soft and has absolutely so loose threads or anything, the colours are lovely and bright and vibrant, this teddy really is excellent and I will happily purchase more from this range to add to the collection. | great toy // 5.0 // 13 May 2013 // By

 on 7 Jan. 2015 // I bought this as a 'companion' for my exuberantly affectionate male rabbit in an attempt to curb his endless advances on my feet.  He wasted no time on formal introductions and instantly took a shine to his classy new lady friend.On the off chance that this is not the standard purpose for buying a stuffed toy rabbit, I can also say that it seems well-made, is a good size and to a realistic scale .  The fur material is soft, stuffing is plump and beans give a decent weight and the eyes don't look like they're going anywhere soon.It was realistic enough that people mistakenly thought it was real in a photo I posted of the toy in the rabbit cage.  Obviously is doesn't look real up close, but it's excellent quality from a toy. | High quality, quite realistic, very soft toy bunny // 5.0 // 27 Oct. 2015 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 27 Oct. 2015 // Hello...  I'm a very well behaved young bunny with a very soft silky coat which is just waiting for you to stroke me.  I have soft, gentle eyes which will look beseechingly into yours in the hope that you will pick me up and cuddle me, a snub nose with whiskers and quite a serious expression but with just the faintest hint of a bunny smile - I'm at that uncertain stage in my life where I don't know where I'm going to be living or when this will be, but all I want is to be chosen and loved and make you or a child very happy.I am made from quality materials which a thick plush fur coat and Living Nature have a close eye for detail in giving me a thick plush fur coat on my body but shorter, denser fur on my ears.  I am very soft with my carefully stuffed body and have a few beans around my rear end to offer a different texture and add a little weight which makes me very huggable and squeezable too.  You have probably already noticed that I am very lifelike and from a distance I could possibly be mistaken for one of those other bunnies that run and hop around with their ears swinging.Regarding my vital statistics, I measure 28cm from the tip of my nose to the base of my soft, fluffy tail, my hind legs are 15cm apart and my head is 12cm above the ground.  I am child-safe but I would also be happy to play with adults too.  My lopped ears are silky soft with a shorter-pile fur on their underside but for some reason, they have been stitched close to my head by my breeder at 'Living Nature'.  A quick snip of the stitch holding them down has released them enabling them to swing freely and much more naturally just as I see on my larger lagomorph relatives.Although I am a very well-bred bunny, I am not quite sure about my breed and would like to keep you guessing.Read more › | Beautiful toy rabbit // 5.0 // 21 Nov. 2012 // By

I ordered this as a present for a bunny mad little girl and she declared that it was perfect and looked just right .  Its fur is super soft - and the detail on this rabbit is beautiful, right down to the lion rosettes in the fur.

TOP 100 REVIEWER on 24 May 2014 // My Blue Nose Friends are an off-shoot of the Me-To-You ""Tatty Ted"" range.""Leboo"" the Lion is lovely and soft to the touch.  His pastel yellow body, salt and pepper grey mane, grey patches, black eyes and whiskers and trademark blue mark nose.He is incredibly tactile and strangely calming to have in front of me.I found this lovely little lion in a local Thornton's but since his appearance on my desk at home he has attracted a lot of attention so I will have to get another so my godson can have his own and my own little lion can remain unmolested by my computer screen.I used to collect beany babies and buddies when I was a child and I was surprised to find out these little darlings have ""beans"" in their tummies too.""Leboo"" is number 126 in the Blue Nose Friends collection and was released in January 2014 - so, if like me, you are new to the series then finding the early ones may be a forlorn hope, but you never know your luck.I will admit that little ""Leboo"" has a placed in my heart and not just on my desk. | Great!! // 4.0 // 2 Feb. 2015 // By

 on 4 Nov. 2014 // Okay so for a start, the pug you actually receive looks nothing like the one on the picture. Mine was sitting down unlike this one and it was a whole lot smaller than what I expected after looking at the measurements provided in the description. Having said this, the dog is still very cute and probably just as nice as the one pictured so I wasn't too annoyed when it arrived looking rather different. It is very soft and I love the fact you can play online as you don't get this opportunity with most other soft toy purchases - a nice touch! So yeah bottom line is the pug is very cute and cuddly, just don't expect it to look the same as the picture shows, at least mine didn't anyway! | Gorgeous // 5.0 // 29 Oct. 2013 // By

 on 7 Jan. 2013 // I bought two of these Steiff teddies for Christmas - one for a 1 year old and the other for a 2 year old.The girls seem to love them as they are small and very cuddly like a plush toy. But beware - I hadn't really appreciated how small 18cms is, so was disappointed when they arrived. So while they're probably a good size for small children they may not be so great for older ones.The other disappointing thing was the packaging - or lack of it. The teddies were in plastic bags , so I had to find more suitable packaging  for presentation.I'm trusting Steiff to have produced something that's robust , rather than just a collectors item - hence the 5 stars for durability. Only time will tell.I've marked ""fun"" and ""educational"" with 3 stars because a teddy probably doesn't deliver either of these in comparison to other toys.But it's a nice bear, well made and begs to be cuddled. | I was really disappointed to see one leg was a lot longer than ... // 2.0 // 7 Aug. 2014 // By

 on 5 Dec. 2015 // Let's be honest, choosing the right Despicable Me unicorn could make or break Christmas if your kids are as unicorn-mad as ours... and it's so hard to tell from the photos and description  which is the ""right"" one to choose.  The eagle-eyed parent might spot that some makes have ears and/or eyes that are more consistent with the movie, whilst other designs seem more or less fluffy... so we decided to choose fluffy over eye and ear accuracy and we are glad we did.  This unicorn is super soft and fluffy, much more like a typical soft pillow pets toy than say a Ty-style ""plush"" toy that tends to be firmer and more velvet texture than soft fluff... after all, you can hardly scream ""it's so FLUFFY!"" on Christmas morning if it's not fluffy! | Perfect cuddly toy for kids! // 5.0 // 31 July 2015 // By

Little tip: You can actually take his hoodie off by simply cutting the stitch in between his eyebrows. The stitch only holds the hoodie so don't worry about ruining the toy. He actually has hair under it.",""

 on 22 Feb. 2013 // I just knew I had purchased a good looking 'doggie' for our godchild, when I saw a local pet shop displaying dog coats on this little fellow. It was just so life like. The seven year old recipient was also delighted with her new 'pet' and has taken it around with her everywhere. Even her Mummy had trouble putting it down, it was so cute. I bought a puppy collar & lead for it, as I felt she would like that and made a blanket for it to sleep on, so I guess the new addition will be really 'at home' and taken care of, very well.So if you are thinking of a pet substitute for a child not allowed any, who might also have  allergies, I would recommend this very highly. It is not all soft and mushy, but has a very lifelike quality that a child over five would enjoy. | My new education assistant! // 5.0 // 7 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 7 Dec. 2013 // As part of my job I visit schools to teach children about looking after dogs and staying safe around dogs . I had a border collie  helping me out, but poor Shep got a few holes in his belly and was bleeding polystyrene 'beans', plus was a bit bulky for getting on the bus, so he has now gone into retirement.Patch is the new pup, and is absolutely fantastic. My only concern is that being predominantly white he might get grubby, then I will have to test how well he washes up. But it is a very realistic Jack Russell size, shape and colour - he even has dark rings around his eyes - and I have been stopped and asked 'is that real?' even by adults - personally I think that, although realistic, it's still fairly obviously a toy! It has a very solidly stuffed body and a stiff wire frame, despite other reviews I find mine doesn't pose well and pings back into the standing shape but I am happy with that.If I'm nit picking one of the seams along a back paw wasn't finished properly, but it was such a tiny fault as to be unnoticeable.This is not really a toy to snuggle up in bed with, but if you are after a realistic looking toy dog you won't go far wrong with one of Melissa and Doug's. | Jack Russell // 5.0 // 29 Oct. 2011 // By

 on 23 April 2015 // Imagine a teenager seeing a naked women for the first time - this is how my 1+ year old daughter reacts to dogs when she sees them. She has a few ""cartoony"" soft dogs, but none of them make her as happy as real dogs do. So it was a logical choice for me to buy a life-like soft toy and I must say the reaction was more than positive. She was playing with her a lot yesterday, so I'm happy. The dog itself is really nice - looks a lot like a real thing and the size is perfect. It seem to have a ""skeleton"", so it stands perfectly even when my daughter is hugging the creature. It's way better than a real dog for me - I like cats way more , so the fact that I don't have to walk it out makes me happy. I also noticed that Melissa & Doug make a 1.2 meter tall giraffe - will probably buy one too.

He also plays with it shaking it by the legs and will share his chair with it.  Considering the hard wear my dog puts it through it is still in very good condition, only needs a wipe over with a damp cloth to bring it up to new looking.

The seems were poorly finished, were brown bits in the white and seems very obvious.  My main problem with it was one leg was shorter than the others, so it looked like it was cocking its leg. I've never had one of these before, so is it supposed to be like that? Impression of movement or something?  Sorry, not a good look.",""

 on 1 Dec. 2015 // We first purchase the 32cm version from Amazon which was nothing like the photo shown either on Amazon or the Seiff website where the photo seems to be the same one for both sizes of bear. It looked smaller, thinner and not so attractive. We returned it immediately for an instant refund from Amazon which was very swift and efficiently handled.Having done a lot more research online we finally decided to order the 40cm version from Amazon not quite sure what we'd get.What we got was a better balanced and cuddly bear  which was closer to the one shown in the photo, but looked like he'd grown up a bit.  I can only think that the photo shown of Elmar on the Stiff and Amazon website is of an earlier version. The proportions are all wrong, most noticeably the eyes on the latest version are smaller, that said he is adorable and will be cherished by our new grandson. It just would be nice if he'd matched the picture.There are a number of comments about if the versions shown on Amazon are genuine as they come in a plastic bag, well they are, tagged and individually numbered so I have no doubt genuine Stiff. If you want the box  buy your bear direct from Steiff.Overall height of bear sitting is 29cm, something we couldn't find out anywhere.Also both the 32cm and 40cm versions have a bulge at the top of his neck, which apparently is normal. | A charming traditional toy // 4.0 // 6 Jun. 2014 // By

 on 6 Jun. 2014 // I bought this bear to celebrate the arrival of  the first baby of my wife's daughter who lives in Florence.  I chose this as a gift as a novelty as the traditional ""English teddy""  is unknown in Italy. I have never forgotten how I loved my Steiff teddy bear as a child. Mine must have been second hand as I grew up in England during WWII when there was no trade with Germany where these traditional toys have always been made by hand. I looked at several models in the Steiff range and selected this one as it is claimed to be machine washable, although I thought it rather expensive. All I can say at this stage is that the baby's mother fell in love with it at first sight - just like I did 70 years ago so what does the expense matter! | Absolutely charming! // 5.0 // 24 Sept. 2012 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2010 // When I received my plush through the post I was shocked at how small it was. Yes yes I know there are measurements there but purely because I didn't order it from this website, I didn't get to see those and going purely on the picture alone it looks quite big.The plush is cute and would be suitable for someone who enjoys the manga/anime series. However there is a warning on it that it 'contains small parts and not suitable for under 15s' ok....under 15s is a new one :D But yeah the little pieces could easily come off so I would be wary about giving it to a small child. | Great Death Note Plush // 5.0 // 4 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 15 Oct. 2012 // Fantastic product, cute, soft, durable and safe. I purchased two puppies for my daughter  when she was 6 months old and they both soon became her most favorite toys. When she was teething she used to bite them quite a lot and both puppies stayed intact. This puppy is very easy to grab, hold and hug for a little one. Now she's 16 months old, calls them both 'Wow, wow' takes them everywhere, 'walks' them, 'feeds' them, will not go to bed without them. The label says they should be hand washed but I put them couple of times through the washing machine and they came out absolutely fine. My daughter loves them and so do I. Excellent, highly recommended soft toy. | Our newest member of the family! // 5.0 // 24 May 2015 // By

I deliberated for a long time about which Jellycat cuddly to get and after a long while I chose this little fella for my 9 month old. She loves him, I love him and I'm so impressed with the quality :) My toy clearly has a label that's states he is suitable from birth- fear not mummies!! | really soft // 5.0 // 11 Dec. 2012 // By

The squishy fox is made from the softest, plushest  fur and is squishy and lovely to hold.I can imagine this would be a lovely toy for children to play with but honestly this is great to cuddle even as a grown man!

 on 3 Jan. 2014 // I purchased this for my two year old granddaughter. She plays with them in conjunction with the Dear Zoo board book. The zoo animals are beautifully made with delightful faces, true to the illustrations in the Dear Zoo books. The puppets are larger than I thought, which makes them easier for the younger child to handle and recognise . Carers and siblings love to join in, which add to the social aspects of learning.  The puppets are quite expensive, but the originality and quality is excellent. The puppets are available on their own or with a soft case. The set with a case is around £7.00 more. The puppets minus case are around £18.99.  Well made, soft and safe. Lots of imaginative play value. Lovely little animal toys that all young children will like.

VINE VOICE on 5 Mar. 2008 // This bird is a retired  TY beanie baby called Dinky.American TY Warner invented the first beanie baby in 1986.Each of his beanie babies has their own birthday.This beanies birthday is September 25th 2000.Also, each beanie baby has its own heart shaped tag with a poem inside.This beanies poem reads:Alright I know, I'm a little smallBut what's so great about being tall?Soon I'll grow up and you will seeJust how beautiful I will be!I only gave Dinky a 4 star durability rating because of his paper tag Dinky is surface washable, and would make the perfect fun gift for a TY or bird lover. | Duck // 5.0 // 18 Sept. 2010 // By

 on 18 Sept. 2010 // When I saw the picture of Dinky the Duck I thought it looked really cute. When it came I loved it even more, it a really colourful beanie and very soft. The tag is the only part that wouldn't last if the teddy was for a child as could tear easily and would need to be removed. Definately worth buying and a great addition to any TY collection. | MUMS SUPRIZE // 5.0 // 26 Oct. 2013 // By

 on 20 Jan. 2011 // THis lovely soft toy has won the heart of everyone in the family. It arrived very promptly.The only thing I was disappointed with was the size as I was expecting something bigger and if you look at the sizes given on the main page they do not correspond in any way to the real thing, plus you don't know the way it is given which is the height, lenght, width or whatever.Product Dimensions given on the main page: 33 x 15.2 x 12.7 cmReal dimensions: Height=23cm; head width= 15cm; length from front paw to tail=23cmAnyway, it's a lovely little tiger. As for the durability, it is difficult to say how long it will last, but the quality of the stitching seems good and all the parts seem well attached to each other, so logically it should last a long time. | Tiger is gorgeous and much loved! // 5.0 // 26 Jun. 2013 // By

 on 5 April 2011 // I bought this for my four year old daughter as a treat for being good. After a little more assembly than I thought, she started playing with it and continued for the rest of the day.It comes with stickers to decorate the little house, and postcards that fit inside the post box - great for imaginative play. Little accessories like a teddy, brush and leash complete the experience.The little dog  skuttles off and if you get it in the house going round the right way, it pops out the door for a drink from the little water and food bowls.My two year old also loves it - but has small parts so keep an eye out.I'm buying these for her friends' birthday parties now.",""

 on 3 Sept. 2014 // I really wanted this Lynx as soon as I saw the new releases for 2014, I saw him in my friends store and took him off the shelf and just fell in love with him! He cuddles into your arms and looks up at you, his fur is very soft and airbrushed perfectly on his face and paws and lightly along his back, a little sweet suede nose that has been sculpted and lovely big cat eyes. In my opinion one of the best plush animals Steiff have done for a long time I HIGHLY recommend this for children and adult collectors too, a lovely companion to admire and hug and hold and treasure for many years to come... 5* out of 5* to Steiff for this piece I am one very happy customer 😊❤️",""

 on 21 May 2009 // I have yet to find someone who doesn't become hooked on this within minutes!  I first discovered Shut the Box at a Pub Olympics and reckoned that it would go down well on a family holiday.  I was right.  From age 11 to 80+, everyone loved it and it occupied far more of a wet and dismal holiday than I could ever have imagined, spanning the generations perfectly and allowing for either solo players or a team challenge.  It now lives permanently on the coffee table and visitors all seem to find themselves strangely drawn to it, whilst my elderly Dad reckons that it keeps his brains sharp and my nephew claims that it hones his mental arithmetic.  One of the best buys I have ever made and genuinely ""fun for all the family"". | Shut the box  Brilliant // 4.0 // 10 Feb. 2012 // By

 on 6 Sept. 2013 // These dice are fine for most purposes. Some adults  with big hands might find them just a little small to use comfortably but children and women should not notice.They are not 'casino quality' in that they are not balanced perfectly. The dimples that have been cut into them for the dots remain vacant which upsets the balance of the dice and won't result in exactly the same statistical probability of each face landing up but for most purposes  you won't notice or care.

 on 28 Feb. 2005 // My daughter received this toy/game for Christmas and I can honestly say the adults enjoyed this more than the kids! The unit is much better than the previous version as there are 2 platforms in which the letters sit. The side with more letters are better for the kids as they can spot more words.A simple shake of the unit to jiggle the letters up activates the battery powered timer...saves the bother of someone watching an egg timer!!After 3 minutes the unit constantly flashes to inform players that the time is up.Educationally this is pleasing. It certainly enhances those literature skills especially for children . The unit is fairly compact and not too bulky either therefore it's easily stored away when not in use.Just be careful not to lose any of the cubed letters!!8 out of 10. | The best Boggle - with a 5x5 grid // 5.0 // 19 Aug. 2015 // By

 on 19 Aug. 2015 // This is the better version with a 5x5 grid instead of the original 4x4. We've never put a battery in the base, we use a timer on a phone. The extra size of the grid  makes this one much more playable - you hardly ever run out of words to write down.  We did try extending it to 4 mins per round but that didn't make such an improvement - maybe 3 mins is about right for most folks' concentration span.Before we got this we were Scabble addicts - Boggle now fills that role because it takes a finite length of time - you agree the number of rounds at the start and that's it, whereas Scrabble can drag on with people sometimes having other bits of their lives to get on with. | Stupid Gimmick // 1.0 // 7 Mar. 2009 // By

 on 7 Mar. 2009 // The flashing lights are one of the most stupid gimmicks I have ever encountered, serving only to make a brilliant game almost unplayable. A bright red neon light flashes throughout the game, from underneath the dice that you are staring at. It is both unpleasant to look at and distracting. You will end up removing the flashing light part, as we did, and then you are left with the old boggle but without an egg timer. My advice is to buy the old version, second-hand if necessary. | super boggle // 5.0 // 2 Feb. 2009 // By

 on 22 Mar. 2011 // I was inspired to buy a box of dice after attending a year one maths class with my son. Having seen the kinds of things they do in class that involved touching, colours and repetition I thought having a mixed bag  of dice would be a fun for all of us to use as counters for bingo, counting or even building games. These dice are brightly coloured and feel like they will last for a long time. I will always know where to go when one of the other board games is missing its dice !

 on 15 Feb. 2014 // So I guess the main thing is, why spend the best part of £10 on 5 dice?Well first, they are nicely and pretty finely detailed and make a change from bog standard dice. The simple black and green colours somehow make me automatically think of Cthulhu and the Lovecraft Mythos; I don't know why but they just do.The 5 and 6 numbers are small, however, this is by design - both numbers have a dominant Elder Sign on their faces with a smaller number in the top corner. This is to allow pretty quick reading of successes as an Elder Sign means you've passed a check  and these signs make for pretty easy spotting.Delivery was pretty fast  and Q-Works saw fit to chuck in a free 10th Anniversary dice that was pretty neat. It has a different graphic on each face relating to other Q-Works Dice series, so that's a nice touch.Would recommend as a little but nice addition to any Arkham Horror set. | Great dice // 5.0 // 5 Feb. 2012 // By

I played this game with my son  and daughter  quite a few times and they got the jist of the game after about the 4th play.  The game is ok, setup is a pain - loads of dice to sort and place. The game plays quite quick once you get going, although there are some major flaws in the game which can ruin it  Basically if you get any dragon card and cull your low powered dice as quick as possible, your gonna win..  not maybe you'll win.. you will win.  Its a fun game,although we have not played it now for around 6monhts.

 on 15 Dec. 2011 // This game is great fun and falls firmly into the same category of class act games like 'Dominion' there is strategy involved in the game but a whole lot of luck is required. The advantage is that most games last about 20-30mins and then you can set it up again to play with almost a completely different game in front of you  the only criticism that I might have is that the time it takes to fish 6 dice out of the bag and roll them may be seconds but is noticeable compared to say drawing cards for a game like Dominion, but this is a minor point and besides, rolling dice is fun.",""

 on 12 Aug. 2015 // I purchased this product to store my yugioh cards in. The capacity is 180 which is enough to store 3 decks with 50 cards in each deck. This still leaves room for a side deck or extra cards. The two dividers you receive are helpful and well made. . The product itself is well made and the cards remain in their place regard less of how many times the box is tossed about or stored in a bag or backpack. I paid under £5.00 for this product and I am really pleased with my purchase and cant recommend this product highly enough to store trading cards in. The merchant was kind enough to package the storage box inside a small cardboard box which not only ensured I received my product in immaculate condition but I am using the cardboard box to store other items I have. Overall I highly recommend both the product and the merchant I used. Great experience and would buy from them again. 5/5. | great item to store yugioh decks n cards // 5.0 // 23 May 2015 // By

 on 26 May 2009 // This game is great - my daughter got it for her 5th birthday and we have played with it since, and she is now nearly 8. The best thing is it is simple and down to the roll of a dice - it helps with counting and learning to take turns. As skill doesn't really come into it, children don't feel disheartened if adults seem to strike ahead as the turn of the dice usually evens things up at the end. My three year old son is now an enthusiastic participant in our games of Feed the Kitty too. | Feed the Kitty // 5.0 // 27 Sept. 2011 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 31 Jan. 2016 // Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.Intergalactic includes images of: planet, a pull down lever, stars, flag, astronaut, robot, satellite, comet etcUses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story . At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.> As a whole class each child could roll and dice and then one by one go around the room with each child adding an element to the story.Read more › | This well made cubes are of the same excellent quality as those of the standard Rory cube collection ... // 5.0 // 30 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 30 Mar. 2016 // This well made cubes are of the same excellent quality as those of the standard Rory cube collection and have that same weight and feel that says quality.The cubes themselves can be used on their own or they can be used with the standard set by replacing 3 random cubes from the standard set.  It adds a new dimension to the story telling giving the stories a more science /science fiction twist.  Great fun for all the family as even the youngest child can take part in one of humanity's oldest past times...story telling.  Although I'm not sure seated around a campfire in your living room is a good idea unless it's a mock up :DI thoroughly recommend these and the others in the Rory Story Cube range. | ... well with my older grandchildren but were not all easily recognized by the 5/6 year olds // 4.0 // 4 Aug. 2015 // By

 on 7 Dec. 2015 // Very pleased with the Dice; they are well made, feature great colouring, are easy on the eyes and roll well However, if you are wanting the plastic box with the dice , you will want to read this next bit:Originally, I thought they all came with the boxes  and checked the reviews for each to check. At least one customer on each product said they had received a plastic box so I went ahead with the purchase.When I ordered 5 sets of 7-dice  they all came in the plastic boxes.When I ordered 2 sets of 7-dice , they instead arrived in plastic re-sealable bags. The bags themselves are fine but I prefer the boxes for better storage.I got in touch with the seller  who explained a number of details to me:When inquiring about the minimum number of 7-die sets to order to get the boxes -'The number at which we send them with boxes depends a little bit on which of our packers processes the order, but normally it's five. Alternatively, if you select expedited  delivery, we send them with the boxes, because we normally use Interlink Express and they don't have the height restrictions Royal Mail applies to large letters.'The seller also said in another correspondence - 'The boxes are more intended as a gift container, and generally don't have a long life expectancy in actual day to day usage.' So don't throw them at the wall to see if they bounce!So, order a minimum 5 sets OR choose express delivery to get the plastic box.If any issues/questions, get in touch with the seller - had extremely good customer service!",""

HALL OF FAMETOP 500 REVIEWER on 21 Sept. 2009 // There's not too much you can write about Dice, but these are of a good size and feel solid and balanced in your hand and when you throw them. They are in the traditional black on white, or white on black style and come in 30 to a pack which makes them very good value for money. These will be perfect for any specific dice games, as well as replacing lost dice from any board games you may have. They could also be used as an inexpensive way of teaching kids about numbers and probability in schools. Great value for money.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page. | Dice // 4.0 // 23 April 2009 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 26 Dec. 2014 // Purchased as a Christmas present, to entertain the family when all stuck under one roof. You can play it two ways. Civilised and with everyone taking a turn, or more as the game suggests, shaking the dice and grabbing for the card you want so you can collect you card sets before anyone else. But be warned, if you pick up a card with a corresponding dice that chimes ... you can't have it. If you play the second version make sure you've got plenty of room and there are no breakables within the immediate area. Especially if over enthusiastic children are playing!  Really good fun.

If you pick a dice with a bell then you don't win the card.  The aim is to collect 2 sets of coloured cards.  Simple to pick up.  Quite a small box so quite transportable.

Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game  based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or ""Lucha Libre"" . Players start with 21 points of health  and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out  or hold the opponent down on the mat for a ""count of three"" to win by a pin. The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die. Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent. Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled.

Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game  based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or ""Lucha Libre"" . Players start with 21 points of health  and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out  or hold the opponent down on the mat for a ""count of three"" to win by a pin. The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die. Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent. Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled.

 on 7 Dec. 2015 // Very pleased with the Dice; they are well made, feature great colouring, are easy on the eyes and roll well However, if you are wanting the plastic box with the dice , you will want to read this next bit:Originally, I thought they all came with the boxes  and checked the reviews for each to check. At least one customer on each product said they had received a plastic box so I went ahead with the purchase.When I ordered 5 sets of 7-dice  they all came in the plastic boxes.When I ordered 2 sets of 7-dice , they instead arrived in plastic re-sealable bags. The bags themselves are fine but I prefer the boxes for better storage.I got in touch with the seller  who explained a number of details to me:When inquiring about the minimum number of 7-die sets to order to get the boxes -'The number at which we send them with boxes depends a little bit on which of our packers processes the order, but normally it's five. Alternatively, if you select expedited  delivery, we send them with the boxes, because we normally use Interlink Express and they don't have the height restrictions Royal Mail applies to large letters.'The seller also said in another correspondence - 'The boxes are more intended as a gift container, and generally don't have a long life expectancy in actual day to day usage.' So don't throw them at the wall to see if they bounce!So, order a minimum 5 sets OR choose express delivery to get the plastic box.If any issues/questions, get in touch with the seller - had extremely good customer service!",""

 on 17 Dec. 2010 // This is a great game for 2-4 players, comprising nine dice with a different letter on each face. A player rolls the dice and then has the opportunity to roll each dice again up to three times with the objective of making the highest scoring word. Each player takes a turn, and the scores are totted up. Play resumes back with the first player until a player reaches a pre-decided winning total.The way the scoring system works is quite clever too, in that there is a compromise between the length of the word and complexity of it, as each letter has a different score associated with it. To score the turn, the number of letters in the word is multiplied by the score of each of those letters .This is a rewarding game where the chance element is large enough to bridge gaps between different intelligence levels, but an enjoyable experience for all. I would recommend this as a family activity, or for out and about, as it takes up almost no space. | Letter Dice // 5.0 // 22 Aug. 2010 // By

 on 6 Jan. 2011 // This game is fantastic. I'd been trying to invent a tactical, strategic game myself that just uses dice. I had thought about lettered dice also, but this guy just seems to have hit the nail on the head. It's very good.I was playing it last night and invented a patience version whereby you can actually play/challenge the dice.Basically you play as usual, but when it comes to the ""dice's turn"" you roll all 9 dice, then remove the vowels leaving just the consonants. You must remove at least 3 vowels. If you could only remove 2 max, then roll the remaining consonants again to produce more vowels to remove. The Dice similarly have 3 rolls max per turn but only if required. If after 1 or 2 rolls the minimum 3 vowels have been removed you then stop rolling. If after 3 rolls you have still only managed to remove 2 vowels max then that is just hard luck. You then add up the word value of the consonants as you would a real word, then multiply by how many consonants, again as you would a real word.? = vowel but Y does not. | Simple but brilliant // 5.0 // 20 Nov. 2009 // By

 on 20 Nov. 2009 // Like many of the best ideas, Dicewords is very simple and the rules can be learned in a couple of minutes.  It has elements of Scrabble and Boggle  but at the same time has its own unique character. It's extremely flexible: it can be played anywhere, with any number of people, for any length of time, and with any level of skill. It can be enjoyed by everyone - from the 6-year-old who can spell a couple of dozen words to the hardened Scrabble fanatic. However, what I personally enjoy most about it is the collaborative element. While Scrabble tends to generate long silences as players struggle with impossible letter combinations, and Boggle creates frantic mayhem while everyone races each other to get the most words, Dicewords invariably seems to encourage co-operation between players. Although each player has their own turn with their own letters, everyone else can watch them put a word together and this often ends up as a group activity. Most of my best words have been made with other people's letters! This does, of course, mean that winning the game is a rather random affair, but it's a great deal more fun than sitting silently for an hour or so. For this reason, it works well as a party game and is a great icebreaker if you have friends who don't know each other well. Of course, it can also be played in a deadly serious and competitive fashion, if that's what you want. Anyone who enjoys word games will love this, and I can imagine it would work very well in an educational environment too. | dice words // 5.0 // 22 Nov. 2009 // By

 on 23 Jan. 2014 // I bought this set as I was looking for nice addition to my D&D gameplay. These are solid dices with one of the best painted pattern I ever seen. Surface is slightly carved/pressed/moulded  so it add depth to the paint job.  Now the best bit!!! I assume as courtensy and as advertisement I recieved 1 carved  6 side dice where each side represent one of patterns they produce. That what I call treating your customers well. Just to mention one of the 3d dices is currently sold for £20  so I consider this as lovely touch as you can actually see how lovely thos paterns look like.On delivery side I was stunned!!!! P&P cost £2.90 Item arrived in 3 days! FROM POLAND!!! That what I call service. Some other sellers could take these Polish fellas as example when they charge you £3.75 or more and than send item 2nd class RM. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 11 Jun. 2015 // By

The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.Medic includes images of: wheelchair, person with a mask on, stethoscope, spotty sad face, needle, plasters, fan, sad face, broken bone etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story . At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible.

 on 22 Nov. 2012 // The dice are fairly standard and are good quality. Only comments I can make on them is that the 4 sided die is a number at top d4, rather than number at base. Not that this really matters. The other point is I would think the ideal set would dice of the same type in different colours so you can roll them simultaneously and have them mean different things eg with both d10 being the same colour it makes rolling them as 10s and 1s to generate 1-100 numbers problematic. However I knew that from the picture just suggesting a differnt ideal mix of the same dice. Also it would be nice to have 2 d6s for completeness. | It's dice how can they go wrong // 5.0 // 17 Jan. 2010 // By

 on 8 Feb. 2016 // Superb game. Great components, and a much more accessible game than Race for the Galaxy. I love my copy of Race' and will be keeping it, but Roll For The Galaxy doesn't have the same massive barrier to entry, and can be taught to new payers in half the time.One or two of the tiles and have overly complex or unclear scoring systems, but generally things are well laid out, with rules written directly on the tiles instead of the cryptic iconography of Race'. Everyone has picked this up fully by the end of their first game, and been eager to immediately play a second. | Top Quality // 5.0 // 17 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 5 Oct. 2011 // I have only recently discovered the game Ticket To Ride but it is, without doubt, one of my favourite games. I immediately fell in love with the version of the game using the coloured cards and was very excited to learn about all the possible expansions. The Dice Expansion really adds a whole new level to the game, it even feels like a entirely different game than the card version. Ticket To Ride is addictive, beautifully simple and immensely enjoyable and with both the card version and the Dice Expansion, it is possible to play this game over and over without it ever becoming too familiar. I currently own the North America version but owning just one is not enough. The Europe version is next on the list! | More train fun // 5.0 // 7 Feb. 2013 // By

It's great for teaching him about sharing, understanding when it's someone else's turn and how to deal with losing, but it's also good fun. He loves it when the ship goes around the board  The game is easy to play and only lasts for 5-10 minutes or so, so can hold their attention and they don't get bored!

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 31 Jan. 2016 // Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.Fright includes images of: monster opening a door, hand coming out of the soil, spider, skull, clown etcUses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story . At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.> As a whole class each child could roll and dice and then one by one go around the room with each child adding an element to the story.Read more › | Good // 4.0 // 3 Jan. 2016 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2014 // I order 2 10x7 and received 142 dice in total. 19 d20, 20 d12, 19 d10, 20 d%, 20 d8, 20d6 and 24 d4.Over all I'm pretty happy with them for the price and I got at least a full set in each colour, though if I ordered just the 1 set I'm not so sure I would have. I mixed the 2 packets of before thinking so I don't have anyway to compare them against each other sadly.My main complaint is with the dice with blank number ink , the numbers generally just look rather shoddy, some of them are okay but a lot of have missing ink, too thick ink or ink just going off of the number. Some of the numbers on the other colour dice don't exactly look amazing either but most are pretty good.Overall you get what you pay for and for the price, I'm happy with them. I would recommend them, but only if your okay with just maybe not using some of the white and yellow dice. | No fuss and they look nice! // 5.0 // 2 Nov. 2015 // By

You can see them, but I wanted ivory / black to give a nice solid contrast that was easily visible to players across the table.On the whole the quality of the 'inking' of the numbering leaves a little to be desired.

 on 25 Feb. 2016 // We bought this for the kids as they liked to use the clicker dice dome in Ludo. On looking on the internet and in shops I couldn't find anything similar but then this dice dome came up on Amazon.  This dome comes with 5 dice, it doesn't feel expensively made  and it isn't but it does the job really well.  The dome is plastic and we removed the yellow privacy cover straight away .  The dome just lifts off so you can put your own dice in or do what we did and take 4 out.  Once  you put the batteries in  away you go.The dome doesn't ""punch"" or flick the dice into the air like a Ludo clicker but at the press of the tiny button the green disc that the dice sit on spins and tumbles the dice. Brilliantly simple and effective. It shipped from China and arrived in about 8 days within the estimated timescale.5 stars as it does what I expected and was good value - it coud have been better made but then it would have cost more so I am very happy with it and its price for the kids.",""

Much better to travel with as there is a spinner  :) Sometimes takes a while for someone to win but it's still good fun spinning the wheel until you do",""

 on 23 Jan. 2014 // Bought this as addition to my order of Runic D&D dices. Its nice little bag made of slightly rough and thicker linen with great runic pattern on both sides. It is bit on small side but I expect that as I didn't want big bag. You can probably fit in 3 sets of dices  and there still will be little of space. As for price, I think £3.95 is bargain. If you gonna buy little neat bag like this from any UK distributor it will cost you AT LEAST £10. Therefore I am more than satisfied with this as it fulfil my expectation and maybe even exceed them.On delivery side I was stunned!!!! P&P cost £2.90 Item arrived in 3 days! FROM POLAND!!! That what I call service. Some other sellers could take these Polish fellas as example when they charge you £3.75 or more and than send item 2nd class RM.Simply put is great item for lovely price with one of the cheepest P&P you ever get. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 11 Feb. 2006 // Yahtzee is a wonderful way to while away the hours, especially during this cold snap. This version is fully contained, portable, light, well designed  and sturdy.For those of you seeking a game with educational value: addition, chance and logic all come into play here. The game is quick to learn and always challenging. It provides an opportunity for single and multiplayer competition.The only issue I have found is that, due to needing the dice shaker to be compacted, its design can occasionally hinder play - I am sure a plastic cup will surfice. | Great fun, but not as good Quality as the old one! // 4.0 // 14 Jan. 2013 // By

 on 14 Jan. 2013 // I had this game as a child and used to play ALL the time so i thought i would buy it for Christmas for my partner  I spent Christmas with the family and we played this for hours on end. The only bad thing i have to say is that the shaker is really bad build quality, it's made up of 3 bits of plastic that falls apart with the slightest shake, unlike the old one that was just a solid cup. Anyways i left the game with the family and bought a new one for us for £3 less than the one i bought a month earlier and the shaker was the same as the last so it wasn't a one off thing. But aside from that it's a great game and for £6.99 a great buy even though you might as well through the shaker in the bin as soon as you open it. | Superb game // 5.0 // 4 Dec. 2009 // By

 on 21 Feb. 2012 // Yatzee isn't a new game by any means but it is a classic, which you'll never tire of pulling out and playing.The game is effectively Poker with dice, tha aim being to get combinations of dice and tick them off your list of required combos, always ensuring you use the wisest combo e.g. if you rolled four 6s you could use this as 4 of a kind or ""all 6s"" and you'd have to decide which was the best to play. Because of this there is some strategy to the game, unlike most dice games which are luck based.My husband and I always take this game on holiday with us, as it's small, portable and requires virtually no set up or space to play. I'd highly recommend it for both this purpose and also as a general family game.Overall, this game is cheap, fun and a nice combination of luck and strategic planning which means that everyone has a chance as long as they ""get"" the concept.

VINE VOICE on 23 Nov. 2011 // Yahtzee is a very simple game. Simply roll 5 dice to create different combinations of numbers, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, etc, record your score, highest score wins.When I was a kid, way back in the 80s, Yahtzee was just played with 5 dice, a plastic cup and a scorecard. Then came a travel version, which had 5 dice in a frame, that allowed you to roll the dice over your hand, and pop them into place when you wanted to keep a dice.This version aims to be somewhere between the two. It comes with a bowl that doubles as the case, along with a collapsible shaker, scorecard and dice. It's worth saying that, if you know the scoring system, and you have 5 dice, you can play this game without buying it...The shaker is flimsy, and it will come apart easily, but it also goes back together easily too.The scorecard is as clear and concise as it ever was, and the carry-case is sturdy enough to take as a travel game.I'd argue that a game where you have to roll dice on a board of any kind is not ideal as a travel game (imagine searching under people's feet for your missing dice.As a game though, it's great family fun, children from about the age of 7 upwards will enjoy it, not least because they can stretch their maths brain a bit, as well as learn about tactics. The big plus for me is that games all take about the same length of time, and no one knows who's won until the totting up at the end, which means no one goes off in a huff because they aren't winning!",""

 on 16 Aug. 2014 // Purchased from LTZmart.  Ordered on 2 Aug and arrived from China on 15 Aug.  The cubes are square, but the print is smudged and not always located in the middle of the cube face.  Lots of excess ink that's also been dripped onto dice.  My set contains 2 blue, 2 green, 2 yellow, 2 red, 2 pink and 2 orange dice.  They'll be fine for school and at £3 coming from China, it's hard to complain, but if you want a well produced product, this isn't it. | Just the job // 4.0 // 23 Sept. 2013 // By

Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game  based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or ""Lucha Libre"" . Players start with 21 points of health  and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out  or hold the opponent down on the mat for a ""count of three"" to win by a pin. The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die. Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent. Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match. In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.","Technical Details Item Weight399 g Product Dimensions13 x 13 x 4.2 cm Manufacturer recommended age:8 years and up Item model numberBSG 1301 Assembly RequiredYes    Additional Information ASINB00ELT2B26 Best Sellers Rank 344,119 in Toys & Games  #997 in Toys & Games > Games > Dice & Dice Games Shipping Weight921 g Delivery Destinations:Visit the Delivery Destinations Help page to see where this item can be delivered.

 on 22 Mar. 2014 // Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a fantastic game. The rules are very easy to learn and the gameplay is really fun. the random element of rolling the dice to attack is balanced with the dexterity element of attempting to slyly nudge your opponents dice from the board when you roll. The tactical element of knowing when to go for a pin, when to save a dice to block with and when to go for a high risk move makes the game complete. Luchador! is a great casual dice roller that gets it right on so many levels. recommended for almost any game collection. | Reviewing the components for Luchador // 5.0 // 24 Sept. 2014 // By

 on 28 May 2009 // My son hates maths so I bought demon dice as an attempt to get him to enjoy the subject, and he loves it!  It's such a simple concept - throw the dice and do the sums, you keep adding together your scores and whoever has the highest score when a player throws an ""Ahhhhhhh"" wins a demon figure.  We play it as the best of 3 rounds.  It's given him confidence in his maths skills and it has a handy carry pouch so he often just takes it out with him in case he gets bored wherever we are. | Good fun // 5.0 // 30 Dec. 2011 // By

Set Up Each player takes either the red or black set of sixteen dice and prepares to set up at opposite ends of the board. Players then simultaneously roll each of their sixteen dice, one at a time. Once rolled, each die is placed immediately on the board. This commences of the left square on a player's back row and continues across to the right. On completion of the back row, the dice are placed from the left again on the next row up. After each roll, each die must be placed onto the next available square. Players cannot select on which square they would like to place each die. Once both players have completed the set up, play commences. Rules The player with the most sixes starts . Players take one turn each alternately. A player can move any one die the number of squares that corresponds to the number showing on that die. For example, if that number is a 3, the player can move that die forwards, backwards, sideways or diagonally up or down in a straight line over three squares. Within the movement the die cannot pass over any other die . If any move results in a die landing on a square occupied by an opponent's die then the opponent's die is 'taken' and removed from the board. Instead of moving a die on any turn a player can opt to rotate one of their dice 90 degrees. For example a die with a 3 showing can be turned over to a 1,2,5 or 6 whilst remaining on its current square. This movement constitutes a player's turn.

Well, nothing in particular, only that like games such as scrabble and chess, and many other such two-player games based on lots of strategy, it seems to take opponents forever to make a move...  I easily get bored with games such as this, as I do like a quick turn around when waiting for players to take their turn.  This is not one of those games for me I'm afraid...  It's a great game still - and I do love it, but unfortunately it will be one of those I do not get out often as a result...  I just SO wish it hadn't been one of those games where players will take forever whilst studying their next move...Still a great game though! | Present // 4.0 // 17 July 2013 // By

 on 7 Dec. 2015 // Very pleased with the Dice; they are well made, feature great colouring, are easy on the eyes and roll well However, if you are wanting the plastic box with the dice , you will want to read this next bit:Originally, I thought they all came with the boxes  and checked the reviews for each to check. At least one customer on each product said they had received a plastic box so I went ahead with the purchase.When I ordered 5 sets of 7-dice  they all came in the plastic boxes.When I ordered 2 sets of 7-dice , they instead arrived in plastic re-sealable bags. The bags themselves are fine but I prefer the boxes for better storage.I got in touch with the seller  who explained a number of details to me:When inquiring about the minimum number of 7-die sets to order to get the boxes -'The number at which we send them with boxes depends a little bit on which of our packers processes the order, but normally it's five. Alternatively, if you select expedited  delivery, we send them with the boxes, because we normally use Interlink Express and they don't have the height restrictions Royal Mail applies to large letters.'The seller also said in another correspondence - 'The boxes are more intended as a gift container, and generally don't have a long life expectancy in actual day to day usage.' So don't throw them at the wall to see if they bounce!So, order a minimum 5 sets OR choose express delivery to get the plastic box.If any issues/questions, get in touch with the seller - had extremely good customer service! | Consider it wisely. // 4.0 // 30 Oct. 2015 // By

What boils down to just rolling dice and matching them to a few cards which represent bombs managed to capture my game groups imagination and set pulses racing as we all worked together to defuse the bombs. You have 10 minutes to do this and time ticks down in realtime, the dice are argued over as you try to defuse the last few bombs...will you make the right choices or will it all go up in flames.

 on 27 Feb. 2016 // Fuse is a game about disarming bombs using dice. The concept is similar to Elder Sign, Age of War or Roll for It, in that the 'bombs' are card with requirements on that you must match with dice.To set up you lay a certain number of bombs in front of each player  and a joint pool of bombs in the middle. You will then shuffle six fuse cards into the deck and you are ready to go. The first player will take a number of dice  from the bag and roll them. Each player must then match one of these dice to a symbol on their card, this could be as simple as the colour or number on the dice, but also can be stacks or pyramids which must be in a certain order. For example you may have to have a stack where each number is numerically more than the last. Once a card is cleared you draw from the shared pool to your bombs, replace the shared card from the deck, resolve any fuse cards that appear, and return diffused dice to the bag. If you don't use all the dice in any one round they must be rerolled and each player loses a die from their bombs of that colour or number if possible.You have 10 minutes to finish which is best monitored with a free app which really adds to the tension. I really like this game. It is hard, and frantic but an awful lot of fun and only takes 10 minutes, it plays 1-5 people with minor adjustments for 1 or 2 players. It can be made harder if you start finding it easy by adding more bombs in and there are a number of super hard bombs you can add in too.The components are brilliant and the symbology on the cards makes sense after one game. This will stay in my collection.",""

 on 16 July 2015 // I'm giving them three stars mostly cause it's expected, unbalanced dice have their uses and cause they look as pretty as in the picture.But that's about it, they are pretty, but as expected from Chessex and other cheap dice makers, they reign from slightly to woefully unbalanced. Your mileage may vary in this aspect.Otherwise the box the dice came in is somewhat brittle tho that may be of little concern if you got your own dice bag/box.On the other hand, the numbers are very easily read and they look very pretty, good show-off dice. | AMAZING COLOUR!!!!! // 5.0 // 5 Mar. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 14 Jun. 2012 // This is a great little set of dice and plastic counters. The set I received included yellow counters. The plastic tube is quite robust and the whole thing is no bigger than a tube of smarties. Each of the three dice have 1 side with an L, 1 with a C, 1 with an R and 3 with a single dot.The game is very simple. You start with three counters for each player and throw the three dice in turn. The letters are the direction in which you must pass a 'coin', to the person on your left or right and C going to the 'bank' in the centre. But where you throw a dot, you get to keep that number of coins.When your next turn arrives, if you have three or more coins then you throw all three dice, if you have two coins then you only throw two dice, or indeed one if you have only one coin left. The game continues until only one person is left with any coins and they then win all the banked coins.Jackpot!Instructions are included but if you've read this far, you already know exactly how to play!We were introduced to this game whilst visiting family on holiday in Ireland and we played with three 5  cent coins each. My 5 and 7 year olds were facinated by it and wanted to keep playing. The great thing is the game doesn't last too long - with 6 people, about 10 minutes per game. We played three games before the kids bedtime and it was just enough for us all.The gameplay is engaging and crucially you get to communicate and have a good laugh together. It's a great way of enjoying the company of others.It's a really inexpensive game and slips into your pocket or hand luggage if you're travelling. A good all-round buy and highly recommended! | simple concept prooves good fun for all ages // 5.0 // 14 Feb. 2011 // By

 on 14 Feb. 2011 // This is so simple yet it has the excitement of ""GAMBLING""! We play it starting with 10 pennies each. We don't put out the player with no pennies, we let them wait in, not throwing the dice, but they'll get a penny passed from left or right eventually - and might win in the end! Age range in our game = 5/6 years to 84. Age 5 learnt left from right. I recommend it to get a group like this to laugh together. | No idea why this is reviewed so highly! // 1.0 // 5 Feb. 2016 // By

 on 5 Feb. 2016 // Bought as a stocking filler for my 4 and 7 year old and am very disappointed!The game is cheap enough and I bought it on the back of reading such positive reviews.I'm not sure if its that my kids enjoy games ranging from pairs and top trumps to rumikub, qwixx, sequence and yatzee but this game is beyond boring! There is no skill involved and my kids  were uninterested after the first game we played.Only positive I found was that it encourages kids to learn left and right.Not sure what I'm missing! | Brilliant family game..... // 5.0 // 20 Jun. 2014 // By

 on 7 April 2014 // A simple concept of a game that all can play from  five and upwards. The game can be played with the supplied counters, but more fun is had by playing for 5 or 10p coins; further, it's a great way of introducing children into the delights of playing for money with all of the highs and lows of winning  money.It's small, compact and a great travel game. | Absolutely love this! // 5.0 // 25 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 25 Dec. 2015 // This is a simple game - trying to explain it would not do it justice. It sounds dull - rolling the dice and moving the counters either left, right or centre - but weirdly, in a group of adults and kids, it really is enjoyable. I play it with the grandparents and my 4 and 6 year olds and we all have fun. It's innocent, old fashioned, anti-television entertainment! | Excellent // 5.0 // 27 Feb. 2013 // By

 on 27 Feb. 2013 // This is such a simple game and good for children to teach them right and left. However, I also bought this as a game for adults to play at Christmas. We play with 1p coins instead of the tokens! You need quite a few people to make it more fun but it can wipe you out of your pennies quite quickly if play a few rounds! Good fun though. | Simple but Fun! // 4.0 // 23 July 2011 // By

 on 23 July 2011 // This is really good fun to play!  Our version of the game is normally played with at least four adults and the counters are replaced by 10p or 20p pieces, so there's a pot of money to be won each round of the game.  It's a very simple game of luck, where no skill is required.  I think it's over-priced, but would still recommend it.",""

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 31 Jan. 2016 // Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.The images include: house, tower, water fountain, balloon, lightening bolt, rainbow, torch, aeroplane, earth, bridges, bee, dice, turtle, eye, clock, key, masks, hands, padlock, balancing beam, compass, moon, speech bubble, stick, tent, fish, lightbulb, sheep etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story . At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.Read more › | Gets the imagination working, old and young!! // 5.0 // 9 Jan. 2012 // By

 on 9 Jan. 2012 // 9 cubes, each with an individual picture of all sides, creating a unique story on each throw.We bought this as ""not sure what to buy"" for a niece and nephew  for xmas, not thinkng for one minute how much fun it would be! Our daughter of 10 was so envious of it we then ordered her one too. We took ours on holiday over the xmas period. Out of all the electronic gizmo's our daughter took with her this game kept her amused the most, which was very refreshing when we live in a world of technology! It really made her use her imagination. We all took it in turns to create the next adventure of the story. She would write out the next chapter to the stories too. We had so much fun listening to the adventures!It is absolutley brilliant, really gets you thinking and rather addictive. And completely broadened our 10 years vocabulary and imagintion. Its small enough to pop into handbag too which meant we could use it the plane, car journey, restaurants etc etc.I totally recommend this product for all ages. Really good fun.

The idea is so simple - roll the cubes & whatever comes up, you make a story to match.  My children like acting out the stories they make up too so this adds to the fun.  It makes a really good family game for everyone to take turns making up stories and makes a change from board games.  I also found them good inspiration when thinking up new bedtime stories.

You get 9 cubes and the idea is to write a story using the pictures as they fall. I often only use 3 dice and write a really short 300-500 word story or a bit of prose. Extend your imagination by taking 1 dice and when the picture comes up do not take it at face value. Write down all the things the picture COULD represent, not just the obvious, e.g. the lightning cube could be lightning, speach bubble, ghost, fir tree etc etc. Let your mind wander. | Years of stories and fun. // 5.0 // 22 Jun. 2012 // By

 on 20 Dec. 2010 // I bought this as a present for a 3 year old. It is a good concept and he could play it with his sisters of 5 and 7 without too much fighting. The idea is that you collect beads by throwing a coloured dice  and stack them in the correct order on posts. However several of the beads would not fit on the posts until we did some judicious sanding- while the 3 year old waited impatiently clutching a red bead- and although the instructions said to ""store the beads in the box lid so everyone could reach"" the packaging does not include a lid but is similar to a cereal box. The beads come in a small plastic bag and roll off of the table at frequent intervals. What should have been a fun game from the start was let down by the quality of the materials and packaging. It will be a fun game now because we have fixed it but thats what the manufacturer is supposed to do! | blast from past // 5.0 // 12 Dec. 2012 // By

TOP 100 REVIEWER on 10 Nov. 2015 // I got a free sample of this to review.The packaging it comes in is nice, though I did notice that everything in the box could easily have fit into something less than half the size. I am not a big fan of boxes too big for the contents, but at least the box looks nice, something moving about inside it will make it more exciting before unwrapping it as a gift, and so it's not all bad.Inside are the three different colours of sand and some moulds to play with, moulds that could of course just as easily be used with regular sand or other things.The play sand doesn't really feel like sand, but like a cross between saw dust and plasticine, not an entirely unpleasant feeling, really, and they are easy to work with, crumbling like sand sometimes, and sticking together like plasticine when you compress them properly.Using one of the moulds, the shape held rather well, though it did collapse a little bit on one of the ridges on the side. Still, an impressive result, I think, for something like this.After using it, there was a little bit of sand dust that I'd not managed to get back in the bag, but whatever causes the sand to stick together doesn't feel as if it leaves any residue on neither hands or work surface. Another good result, I think.Had I still been a child, I would have thought this was great fun - well, I still think it's great fun, to be honest. It is something that has a lot of potential for creativity while avoiding being too messy. | A fun set // 4.0 // 10 Dec. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 10 Dec. 2015 // My daughters  have really enjoyed playing with this kinetic sand. The sand flows easily but when compressed it will retain its shape whether through using the three supplied moulds or their hands. They have even decided to use their collection of play doh moulds and cutters to great effect.I have found it is best to use the sand on a large tray because it does tend to get dropped on the floor / carpet. The bigger lumps are easy to pick up and the smaller pieces can often be collected by tapping them with bigger pieces, but it's almost inevitable that the vacuum cleaner will need an outing at the end of play.  That in itself is not a problem but it does mean that each time the sand is used a small amount is wasted.The sand supplied with this kit is in bags that have to be cut open so we have transferred the sand to zip lock bags and that works well. However, much like the afore mentioned play doh eventually it all gets mixed together and ends up as a lovely brown, so at the minute we have four bags of sand.In terms of use I find that ensuring the girls have clean dry hands is the best way to stop and sand sticking to their skin. I have also found it useful to have a soft paint brush to clean the play doh moulds to recover all of the sand.So there we are: it's better in many ways than play doh because it's easier to clean up and it doesn't set rock hard if left exposed to the air. I have to say I was surprised just how much my daughters like playing with this sand and it holds an edge very well so it is possible to produce some very lovely creations that only children can.Please note this sand was sent to me for review purposes. | Mess free fun for children // 5.0 // 6 Dec. 2015 // By

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWER on 6 Dec. 2015 // Disclaimer: I received this product for a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.The packaging is quite large and colourful - but I would say slightly generous with its claims for the product inside. The box is a bit bigger than it needs to be to hold three light packs of play sand, three  moulds and a container which for me was actually an almost broken plastic tray which got pushed aside and replaced straight away.The coloured play sand itself is a fun gift for any young child - with three reasonably sized packs of yellow, green and pink sand enough to keep kids entertained for a while. The different coloured sands inevitably mix together but that's to be expected and surprisingly, any mess on the floor or surfaces are easy to clean off. The sand is easy to mould and manipulate as it is soft and sticky, but not to the level that it's too sticky to use - hours of fun! The shapes once they come out of the three moulds last well and are worthwhile - though they're only likely to be used once and then forgotten about. Overall, the set, though a little on the small side, is creative and fun and makes a pretty nice present.",""

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWER on 17 Dec. 2015 // This is a really fun play set for kids. Mine loves playing in the sandpit during the summer but now she can do pretty much the same thing indoors during the colder months.My little one has lots of Play-Doh sets and loves this kind of creative toys. This sand is a bit different from Play-Doh and it does not dry out. I would say it is not a replacement for Play-Doh but rather a different game altogether.This sand has a kind of spongy consistency and sticks together quite well. Using the included moulds the shapes are coming out nicely even with the small details being visible. It is sticky but after a while it breaks apart again, it is actually fun to watch. Looks almost like it is moving on its own - have a look on my video.It is completely odourless and does not stick to hands and most importantly to carpets. This makes it very easy to clean after your kiddo makes a mess. You can just vacuum it up from carpets and on solid floors it can be easily swept up.The amount of sand you get in this set  is a good starting point. You can easily do a couple of moulds from it in one go. However, if you want to build something like a decent size sand castle you will need a few more packs.In the box you get a plastic container for storing the sand. It is only made out of thin plastic and it will easily break so would recommend getting something sturdier. Sand comes in a sealed plastic bag stored away in the container. You also get three moulds, princes cardboard cutouts and some jewels.The box itself is very nice with lots of colourful pictures. Perfect for a gift. One thing I did not like is the fact that all the things you get only take half the space inside. The other half is empty so the box could be much smaller.Read more › | A truly fantadtic play sand set. // 5.0 // 11 Dec. 2015 // By

TOP 100 REVIEWER on 11 Dec. 2015 // • Note: The supplier kindly sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinions expressed here are entirely my own •Lovely printed full colour box with all the items inside. This is a great gift for children that enjoy playing with play sand. The theme of this set is disney princesses. Included in the box are the following:-3 moulds450 grams of pink play sand 24 jewels4 different cardboard princess cutoutsThis would make any little girl very happy to have such a lovely complete set, it has all 4 princesses . They come as cutout cardboard shapes to play with and decorate and make your own Disney Princess scene.The moulds are firm plastic and are not flexible but should last long as they cannot be easily broken. This set is really suitable for young children and the moulds could be reused again and again and if you should run out of the play sand provided you could always use the moulds with clay, glycerine soap or beach sand. They are small enough to pack in a ziplock bag and take with you to the beach.Really sweet set that I am sure lots of little girls would be happy to receive at Christmas time. Best to play with an adult present due to small jewels. Also, best to store in a different tub to the one provided as it is not that strong and will break in time. | Jewels, princesses and pink magic sand // 5.0 // 16 Dec. 2015 // By

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 16 Dec. 2015 // This is a beautiful Disney Princess play sand set a good 'novelty' product for children who are perhaps more accustomed to more usual toys. It is certainly different and it has a real novelty value that is guaranteed to grab and hold their attention.The box contains a bag of sand, a tray and three moulds. The sand itself is basically sand mixed with a harmless polymer and a bright pink dye. The polymer makes the sand grains stick together slightly so if you pack it into a mould the sand holds the shape of the mould for a while. The adhesion gradually breaks down and the sand shape slowly falls apart into semi-loose grains again. It's a bit like playing with set sand on the beach but the sand is more 'sticky' and the polymer helps give any moulded shape greater definition.The polymer itself is clean and odour-free. The sand has no distinct smell and it doesn't leave any sticky residue on your hands. It doesn't stick to carpets or solid surfaces or anything. If you do get any on the carpet you can just vacuum it up.The sand is coloured bright pink although you can buy lots of other colours separately if you want .Overall this is a great toy sand set and I would highly recommend it.Please note I received this in exchange for a honest review and this has not biased my opinion in any way.",""

 on 5 Dec. 2015 // ★ PLAYMOBIL★ 5494★ 2015★ AGE GUIDE : 4-10 ★ 101 pc★ Assembly instruction booklet includedI always pop a chunky advent calendar in my basket to have from Amazon, and when the price decreases ; I place the order, which happened in October this year.The colourful, quality box measures around 40 cm x 30 cm x 8 cm overall and comes in a strong outer carton for safe transit.◄ SPOILER ALERT! ►Like a box of crackers, the box has a cardboard overlay detailing the contents, day-by-day, which I have gone on to show in my images to give an idea of the content this year.  I discard this layer when giving as a gift so the recipient doesn't  know what to expect behind each window.  If it is opened carefully, there is no evidence of this.Underneath, on one side of the box is a tree-framed, snowy scene with a path meandering off into the distance with an inbuilt hanger to put on a wall, if required.  If just standing the calendar on a flat surface, which is quite successful due to its depth, the hanger just looks like the moon in the wintry night sky and doesn't spoil the scene.On the other side are the advent calendar windows, showing Santa & his elves, busy with preparations and loading the sleigh, watched over by an angel.  The windows vary in sizes and the numbers are easy to spot, each surrounded by a bright yellow star.  They are relatively easy to open, by depressing and pushing back on the tab, and then tear the perforations.  The rewards occasionally need basic assembling, adding to the fun.The contents are designed to go on the colourful backdrop - the base of which measures around 46 cm maximum x 24.Read more › | She was absolutely delighted when I gave it to her on 30th November ... // 5.0 // 23 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 29 Dec. 2015 // My sister made me an advent calendar back in 2004 out of matchboxes, papier mache and the Playmobil nativity sets, after all this time it is getting rather battered and loved but my two young children adore it. I was delighted to discover Playmobil made their own calendars a few years ago but at the time the price was out of my range and I didn't think it looked like you got much inside for the price. How wrong was I! On the spur of the moment I ordered this the last week of November, my husband was not impressed when he realized I had spent nearly £25 on an advent calendar/Seasonal toy. However when it arrived one look on the back of the box swayed him. Note: Don't let the recipients of the calendar see the back of the box for it shows you what you receive behind each door! Each door holds something for Santa's workshop, e.g a blue basket with six teeny tiny animal figures , a wheelbarrow and teddy bear, carrots for the reindeer, a ""present"" with toy racing car. There are four little card boxes behind various doors which you need to fold up into presents. This advent calendar comes with four figures - An angel, two elves and Santa himself , all hidden behind a different door. Inside the box there is a beautiful cardboard backdrop, you have to pop out some parts and fold it to make it stand. It really is gorgeous and the children loved setting up the scene each day. The card game you get is just a little box with a simple game of snap  inside. I think my children would have preferred an extra toy for the grotto but it is a nice idea. I will definitely be buying these annually. The excitement on my bairns faces each morning was wonderful and something you would not be able to get from a chocolate calendar. Plus they have a beautiful toy to get out every Christmas. | We all loved it. Bit tricky keeping all the bits together ... // 5.0 // 31 Dec. 2014 // By

 on 31 Dec. 2014 // First time I have bought one. We all loved it. Bit tricky keeping all the bits together especially with small kids, but I managed it by only really letting them play with it Xmas eve when it was complete . The doors are quite firm so smaller kids need a bit of effort to open them. I had to open the door for my 3 year old to break the perforations then close it for her to open in the morning. As I have all the bits, it may be back again next year and I can mix up all the pieces for them. I will be looking to see what other ones there are too.",""

 on 5 Dec. 2012 // As you can see from the picture this advent calender folds into a square.  Each side is about 3 inches by 5 inches tall.  The idea is that a nighlight can be placed inside the square  and when all windows have been opened the candlelight will shine through them.  Well printed and very Christmassy.  I bought different calenders in this series so there are going to be other reviews the same as this one - all the calenders were a success. | Advent calendar // 5.0 // 2 Dec. 2013 // By

The bauble was delivered well packaged, quickly and looked really good. It is heavier than you might expect, giving the impression of quality.You also get a chance to personalise both sides and include up to 4 lines on the back. My wording was acknowledged quickly by the seller after I sent a message using the 'contact seller' button.All in all, I am really happy with the purchase and I look forward to giving the happy couple a keepsake that will remind them of their special day each passing year. | Lovely Gift // 5.0 // 7 April 2014 // By

This could be bought for any married couple no matter how long they are married as you can personalise the date. As well as the date you can add the name of the couple and a personal message on the other side. Something a couple can keep and use on their tree year after year I highly recommend this.

 on 25 May 2009 // The first time i played this game was in school with twenty, 17 year old, class mates. The game has no limit on the number of people wishing to play it - even one person can play alone. The game only requires logic to play it - it has no complicated rules. I would suggest that the game is suitable for anoyone older than 11 years.It is a superb game with many permitations and combinations of the board - so it is impossible to have the same experience with the game twice. It is a truely brilliant game with an educational spin that will develop speed of thought and logical thinking. ***** | Fantastic game // 5.0 // 4 April 2013 // By

Customer service was accommodating and pleasant when we wanted to change delivery address after putting the order through. Our only complaint is about the piece at the centre, which is supposed to hold the pieces of the board together; its legs are a bit shallow and slip out if playing on a tablecloth on the table.

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 20 Oct. 2010 // For a little more money than a sugarific choccie advent calendar you can have this wonderful Lego calendar with a new mini-build every day through the advent period.And, of course, you still have the Lego after Christmas, rather than a chocolate addiction.The 24 different builds are fun and varied, with a Christmas and gifting theme.  A total of 6 miniature figures are included, two of them Santas, one of which is naked!  There is also Santas shower, which explains why he is naked.Other mini models include a Christmas tree, train set, snowman, helicopter, fire engine and much more.Much fun will be had with the daily models and after you have done your first Lego advent your children will want to do it every year after.Highly recommended. | Lego Advent // 5.0 // 19 Nov. 2010 // By

 on 19 Nov. 2010 // Not sure of what to get a 6 year old for his birthday and so close to Christmas - I saw this advertised and thought what a brilliant idea - when he is fed up with all his other presents he still has this one to unwrap everyday until Christmas!Arrived gift wrapped the day after the order and wow - little 6 year old was over the moon. A great present and something to enjoy everyday and also something to add to over the next few years - birthdays and Christmas all sorted!!! | Lego Advent Calendar // 5.0 // 24 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 24 Dec. 2010 // I bought this advent calendar for my son - he loved it.  Each day has a separate model with a guide to build the model in the flap.  There is a fold down card base for putting the models on, if wanted, and together they make a Christmas scene - parents at the table, children playing with various toys and musical instruments,a dog and a cat, a fire to sit in front of, snowman - including a carrot nose - for the garden and of course a Christmas tree.  My favourite - and sure it was put in to amuse parents - was Santa taking a shower!As with all lego it is quite pricey, but will last for eons and can be integrated with other lego models, or brickes just used for free crafting.I would certainly buy one again.  Much more fun than chocolate! | good fun // 5.0 // 6 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 6 Dec. 2010 // not cheap as advent calendars go but it's one of the best I've seen and my son actually plays with it after he's built the pieces. Far better than getting a sweet or chocolate every day. My son is 10 and loves all things lego. Most of all he likes to construct his own designs and he likes that you can mix and match each days build. They are proper lego bricks but also have pieces that you wouldn't generally find like skateboards and drum kits. We're only on day 6 but it's a huge hit in this household and I'd thoroughly recommend it for both boys and girls - it's certainly the type of thing I would have loved as a kid | Every lego fan's dream // 5.0 // 1 Jan. 2011 // By

 on 1 Jan. 2011 // This is simply a must-have for every lego-obsessed child  Rather healthier than a lump of chocolate, and rather more exciting than your average picture of a robin on a snowy branch, this calendar does it all. Anticipation every morning to see what is in the next window, the chance to build a little set every day, marvel at its cuteness, put it all together at the end to make a fantastic scene, and this is all before Christmas Day! Yes, it's a little on the pricey side for a calendar, but it's a wonderful item that I will be buying for my son for many years to come. | Excellent value for money // 5.0 // 17 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 17 Dec. 2010 // It may seem a lot to pay for an advent calendar but there is a small toy in each window which your child can build each day.It's a great incentive to get them out of bed on a cold winter's morning! My son was ill for a couple of days but still managed to open that day's window before going back to bed! All the toys can be built up into a Christmas scene which compliments any other Lego your child already has.I can already see we will be getting one every year from now on. | Great fun // 5.0 // 24 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 24 Dec. 2010 // The Advent calendar entranced my two girls , although my wife suspects I bought it for me . There are lots of  cute little toys inside, and lots of special pieces . The only real down side is that the instructions to make each model are limited to a picture on the inside of the day's door, which in most cases was enough, but challenged the younger girl a bit. | How To Get The Kids Out Of Bed // 5.0 // 18 Dec. 2010 // By

    Ms. A. Barker
  
 on 8 Dec. 2013 // I admit it, I'm an adult who is a fan of Playmobil. Despite having no kids, every year my partner and myself buy a Playmobil advent calendar each and we have a lot of fun opening them every day on the run up to Christmas. My partner has the Pirate Treasure Cove calendar this year.This year I decided to get this slightly unusual calendar as I hadn't seen it for sale anywhere else. It's available from Playmobil's German site but not from their UK one . I like dragons and fantasy stuff like that, and this calendar looked completely bonkers with a dragon, two knights in full armour and weaponry, a ballista thing that shoots bolts across the room, some treasure and a magic dwarf shooting lightning from its hands. What's not to like?As it is only Dec 8th I've only opened a few windows so far but we both found that the items that we received in our calendars would allow a child to start playing immediately - day 1 gave us both a figure, the next few days gave us accessories for the figure and we both got a larger item on about day 6 so we didn't feel fobbed-off with getting tiny accessories all the time. I think a lot of thought has gone into the ""timing"" of each item in the calendars.As for quality, everything is up to Playmobil's usual standard. Some items require you to assemble them so children may need a hand with this, though they're more fiddly than complicated. The boxes come with a nicely-printed cardboard diorama so you can display your collection as you open the calendar and receive the items. | A Great Product // 5.0 // 1 Oct. 2015 // By

It was late in arriving, but the children didn't mind too much since they had the excitement of opening lots of doors in the one go. What was not acceptable was that several of the items for Unicorn Fairyland were incomplete. When paying a high price for items one expects a high standard. Very disappointing. The Dragons Treasure Battle was perfect and the children had no complaints about that whatsoever. All concerned were allowed free choice over which calendar they opened, and it was interesting to note that only one girl chose the Dragon calendar.

 on 16 Jan. 2016 // Purchased half price, thus making this a well worth buy!  My 8yr old quickly figured out days the larger parts of the set were behind, , but it didn't impact on his enjoyment and excitement of opening a window and finding another playmobil character or item.There's also a playmobil card game included, which kept him, and his friends entertained for hours.I personally, would not spend £20 on an advent calendar, no matter how awesome - and this was awesome, so finding it for half price was fantastic.  Furthermore, this set goes beautifully with the main gift I bought my son, which is one of the playmobil castles, that again, I managed to purchase on offer.  I never quite saw the appeal of playmobil before, seemed like lego's poor cousin, however, after observing my son playing with the stuff, I am a convert.  Its well constructed, sturdy, and offers great imaginative play opportunities, and its reasonably affordable, especially when offers are on. | I always find Playmobil advent calendars good value for money and this one was no exception // 5.0 // 24 Dec. 2014 // By

We paid £7 less to receive a damaged box; when it arrived the outer box had a big bash in the middle but the advent calendar itself inside was barely touched, showing just how protective the outer box is.

 on 26 Jan. 2016 // I bought this for my three nephews aged between 7 and 10. They all thought it was brilliant - I didn't expect it to be such a hit! It's really cool stuff actually as although it acts like sand, it can be moulded into other shapes e.g. they made a hedgehog, a tower and a mouse! It sort of feels like something between sand and putty. One thing I will say is that it needs to be played with on a tray as the sand does still cling to whatever it was on/ whoever touches it. So after playing, my nephews did need to wash their hands.I wouldn't want to try and get it out of carpet!I bought it in green which was a nice vibrant colour, and the 1.5 lb bag was a good amount. Once finished, it needs to be stored somewhere that will keep in moisture like a sandwich bag or tupperware box.Note: if you have animals in the house, especially dogs, it is important that they are kept away from it. If they ingest it, it can be almost impossible to 'pass' as properties of the kinetic sand cause it to reshape every time the body tries to push it. | This product is one of my favorite inventions!

Not only is it a great molding alternative to the usual molding clay or Play-Dough for children  but it is also a wonderful relaxation toy/tool for adults.The sand particles stick together firmly or softly depending on pressure. We keep it in a sizable container that my son can play in and after playing with it myself over and over, just with my hands  or with a sculpting tool .If I had a criticism  it would be price  - wish it would be cheaper.

The models then go on the flap that folds down from the front of the box to build up your Lego story scene...the kid in everyone will love setting up these models to tell their story simply because it is so much fun, festive visitors always comment on our Lego advent calendars and somehow seem to end up playing with it, rearranging the scene or modifying the model in some way.The models are your usual Lego quality, fun to build and take part again time after time, the designs are a quirky twist on the usual star wars Lego and the whole thing is great....more expensive than any other of the Lego advent calendars but still great....if you want to try to recoup some money the little men , particularly the limited edition special Lego men are very collectable and have a whole market of buyers who you can sell them to when the new year comes...if you can bear to part with them that is.After all the talk, this set passes the ultimate kid test...they love it, can't wait to open the doors each morning and build that days model , never forget to open the window .Read more › | A lot of fun // 3.0 // 9 Nov. 2015 // By

 on 9 Nov. 2015 // Oh dear the price hikes have started. This is a good Lego calendar. You get lots of lovely little Lego starwars pieces, but you also get some fillers that are a bit of a let down, like the fire for example. The figures are great and on the days when you open the door to reveal R2D2 it puts a smile on your face for the rest of the day, they are definitely the star of the show. The box flap is a great place to build your Lego starwars Christmas scene and no visitors can not resist playing with - many are very jealous and many who don't have one this year will have one next year after seeing mine. Each model is quick and easy to put together - you don't get  instructions with some of the little bags of pieces, but the picture on the front of the box pretty much explains what you need to do. There are several little bags with spare pieces too.It is a great countdown throughout December and a million times better than the cheap chocolate ones. | great way to anticipate christmas // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 14 Dec. 2015 // This item is a very good way to count down the days to Christmas.the 24 micro builds inside range from all areas of the galaxy such as; Tatooine, Endor and even the empire.The box itself is very well put together, the doors do stick at times and tend to rip if not opened with care. The instructions for each model can be found on the bak of the windows/doors of the respective day and build.DO NOT expect incredibly detailed builds, however the mini figures are as good a quality as ever and for small builds you really do get a treat vevery day.If you are a fan of Star Wars then this is worth the £20 price tag. however if you are not a big fan of either franchise, then this product could be seen as overpriced. | Fantastic daily fun // 5.0 // 28 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 28 Dec. 2015 // Another fantastic advent calendar. Yes it may appear expensive, but it is well worth the money for the excitement each day opening the next door. Also, if you consider the number of pieces included, the price isn't too bad.This was our 3rd Star Wars advent calendar, and it didn't start brilliantly as we had  have any idea what the build is! But the rest of the  days were great, especially the last 3.The best thing about this year's is that it is not year specific , so you can always buy this one to use Christmas 2016+. | Only for true Star Wars fans // 3.0 // 16 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 15 Feb. 2016 // Kids tore the box apart to get at the toys and destroyed the advent calendar dimension in the process. That they entirely missed the point of an advent calendar and remain none the wise despite an explanatory telling off is more a factor of their age  than the design of this product. But as precious money was wasted and Lego are still doing just fine, especially with their new movies and what have you, I feel three stars is justified.",""

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 2 May 2014 // Our six year-old had saved up £7 and wanted me to get the Jek14 minifigure for him.  Except to buy the minifigure on its own was going to cost £16.  No way was I spending £16 on a tiny bit of plastic that wasn't even in the original star wars films!  But I had promised to get Jek 14.  So I ended up paying an extra £38 for this kit.  And it hurt!  It wasn't Christmas or anyone's birthday and we don't want to spoil him.  I physcially groaned for a couple of days after paying for this.  But - it really is good!  Little one got his Jek 14 minifigure, and we all spent some happy family time building the aircraft, which is not for building in a day, but rather over a week or two.  It looks really good when finished and it's the biggest lego ship he's ever had.  I have now said - no more toys until Christmas.  I have to say that although £45 is a heck of a lot to spend on lego, it is kind of worth it and better than spending £60 on lego. We also found it was nicer and more relaxed building a lego kit at this time of year , as everything is so hectic at Christmas and there are so many other things to do.  The pain of spending the money is wearing off a bit now - I'll just have to sell some of his old baby toys to recoup!  The finished ship is about 14"" long and about 13"" wide and is quite impressive to see.  It comes with four minifigures - Jek 14, an R2 type droid, a blue Clone Trooper type thing and a bounty hunter.  The age range says 8 to 14 but our six year old found it a piece of cake to build - if a child under 8 has built a couple of smaller kits before, they could manage this I reckon.  It helped that there were two large  sized instruction booklets with it, with easy to see diagrams spread out in short stages.Read more › | Super // 5.0 // 24 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 11 Feb. 2016 // I did my homework on all the available sands of this type and gunned for this one, its not only much cheaper than Kinetic sand but you get twice as much! it makes a lovely sand mould and holds its shape, I'm worried that when my boy  next goes to the beach he will be disappointed that the real sand is not as good !  Ive been using this sand inside a stand up table  inside the house, in which it took 6 boxes  to fill, the only one issue I've found is that when it spills over onto my kitchen tiles it seems to leave some kind of residue that makes the floor slippery, which is strange as i once brought a bunch of foam tiles  for baby safety which also left my wooden floors like an ice rink once removed! .  But I'm reviewing the sand itself and id have no problem recommending this motion sand, I'm pushing the kids aside to make sand castles of my own!! ;-) it says the sand is for 3 plus, but my boy is half that age and loves it, he has strong hands which is helpful as this sand does require some hand/finger pressure at times to scoop, dig & mould.  Update - having had it a few weeks now I'm finding that if left a few days without use in a colder room it goes very firm and less dough like which is not a good thing as its harder for my boy to use, so i have to spend time mushing it up to try and make it softer. so not sure if its the cold or what, but ill keep my eye on it. | Fantastic // 5.0 // 26 Jun. 2015 // By

 on 8 Jan. 2016 // This is great! My children love it; they are 6 and 2. And I love it as it's so easy to play with and not really messy at all! It is much easier to build sandcastles with than regular sand; my two year old has trouble building with regular sand but she can build easily with this.Lots of these reviews say it's messier than playdoh but I don't think it is! The problem with playdoh is that it ends up stuck to my children's bums and socks after they drop tiny bits and sit/stand on it, then it dries, is hard to get off and gets carried on to carpets and furniture.This doesn't stick to hands, clothes, hair, carpets, or anything except itself. If any gets dropped you can just pick up a small ball of it and use that to clean up the little bits.If it is squashed together firmly it is really quite strong and doesn't crumble and fall down like regular sand does making it great for building elaborate sandcastles. It doesn't dry out so I imagine the structures that are built could last for a very long time if you wanted them to.It is like a cross between sand and playdoh but is better than both in my opinion. | Great Product // 5.0 // 24 Aug. 2015 // By

The animals are very thin on the ground in this box set, its mostly extras for animal play, I was hopeing it would be more balanced, and was quite shocked at the stickers as that wasn't mentioned and really isnt very fair!

HALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWER on 16 Jun. 2014 // This timer is rather large. I know it was going to be big and as I wanted a little one like this and couldn't find one I settled on this one. It is 6.5 inches in height and 2 3/4 inches wide. The orange salt runs through really quickly and lasts 2 minutes. Great for using to time infusing your tea or use as any type of timer including an egg timer. Quite bright orange, fashionable and looks just like the picture.Looks well made and I do hope it will last, it seems like it will. | Used as a tooth brushing timer // 4.0 // 7 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 7 Mar. 2016 // Great for using as a tooth brushing timer.  Not incredibly accurate as it's out by a few seconds.  However, I don't think anyone who wanted super accuracy would be turning to this.  We had used the tiny timers in the past but they kept getting dropped, lost and broken in the bathroom.  This is a substantial item which will last a long time.I wish there had been more colour options for the two minute timer, but that's just a minor issue. | Perfect // 5.0 // 7 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 24 Nov. 2009 // This lego advent calendar is quite a novel product, with each door opening to a lego minifigure or other lego accessory, most of them Christmas based. The entire box contains around 250 pieces, with a great deal of them being special pieces rather than just basic bricks, which makes the calendar even better. The flap of the advent calendar also doubles up as a playmat, with road, snow, some grass and a frozen lake.If you can afford the bigger pricetag than a simple chocolate advent calendar and you have children who enjoy lego, then this is an excellent buy as a countdown to christmas. | Lego City 7687 Advent Calendar // 5.0 // 9 Nov. 2009 // By

We are only at day 13 so have not opened all the doors yet.The calendar is a great way to encourage the kids to be good during the day so they can open the door at night, they love taking it in turns to open each door and they know from the packaging that they will be getting a santa lego man; we are all having bets to see which door he will be behind.I have to say that Lego is fantastic for little minds.  My son shows me the things he makes and I am always suprised what a great imagination he has with the lego.  I would always recommend any lego product as my children have hours of fun with it.

You get the usual festive fun in the countdown to Christmas by building a new mini-figure or other item each day and can either re-use next year or add the bits to your existing Lego collection and buy a different one next year. The models are completely non-religious; the Lego City advent calendar features winter-related themes such as snowmen, ice-skating and sledging and secular themes such as Christmas trees and Father Christmas.

This is the first time they have really taken an interest in advent calenders and now they can't wait to open each door. I think for what you get its good value for money as playmobil toys aren't cheap! it includes two knights and two horses all with armour as well as a King and his throne and a prince and lots of little accessories.  I did have to buy one each though to avoid arguments but well worth every penny. | Playmobil Advent Calendar // 4.0 // 10 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 16 Jan. 2011 // Since last year, I buy a toy calendar rather than the traditional ones with chocolate. I find children eat too much sweets/chocolate this days. Last year, I bought the Barbie advent calendar and it was perfect. It was for my older daughter. This year I bought the My Little Pony calendar for my 2,5 daughter. Maybe she was a bit too young but she liked it anyway. There were just 2 or 3 times where there were only stickers to be discovered and for the price of the calendar, I think they could have put a little accessory.

VINE VOICE on 22 Dec. 2009 // My daughter has had these types of calendar for the past 3 years, first a lego one, last year a playmobil forest one and this year the fairy world one.  None has disappointed although the playmobil ones are self assembly and great fun  was had sorting out the instructions.  The calendar is like a large deep box with windows for each day and it comes with a cardboard set, in this case of a fairy wood with rainbows and waterfalls.  This one was better constructed than last year's and the delight on my daughter's face as she opens each door is amazing.  Playmobil's durability and quality are second to none as ever, everything fits as it should.  An absolute delight | Waste of money - Terrible // 1.0 // 1 Dec. 2010 // By

This calendar is self assembly , instructions are rubbish, the cutting line goes the wrong way on the cardboard.We normally like playmobil but this calendar is so bad that I won't be buying another one, I shall be sticking to lego ones in future! | play mobile fairy advent calander // 5.0 // 29 Nov. 2009 // By

One of her present for xmas was the underwater world from Playmobil and she can actually mix the fairies and the mermaid and she has lots of fun. It's a bit expensive but I believe it's worth it and it's much more fun than the traditional chocolate advent calendar. Would recommend it to anyone.

 on 1 Dec. 2010 // I have to admit, I was more excited than my daughter about this advent calander, and when it arrived I wasn't dissapointed. Unlike other reviewers, all the items were already in the boxes ready to go, so all I had to do was open it, set up the cardboard scene provided, and then let my daughter open day number one!Its lovely, really captures the imagination, my daughter has been playing with the figure she got behind door one all day and can't wait to see whats behind door no.2.oK, its pricier than a conventional advent calander, but its worth it. I'm just counting this as one of her xmas presents, and I will buy her some more fairy playmobil for christmas. | Christmas begin early. // 5.0 // 8 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 8 Dec. 2013 // I cannot thank Playmobil enough for having such a wonderful idea. This beats putting chocolate or sweets into the boxes each day. The count down to Christmas is much more fun with the Playmobil figures and children feel they are really being spoiled by getting a proper present each day, . A fantastic incentive.As the collection increases over the 24 days, the fun increases. The good things is that many of the figures , can be integrated with existing Playmobil characters and can be used throughout the year. Not just for Christmas.",""

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 20 May 2015 // I purchased this on a whim as I thought it would be a fantastic rainy day activity. The advised age range is 3 years+ but I have no issues letting my 17 month old son play with it supervised.The box contains;1 bag of kinetic/motion sand9 moulds - Seahorse, shell, car, plane, train, crab, boat, star, fish1 x roller which creates animal paw printsProps - Hat, 2 x arms, 2 x hands, 1 x eyes,  1 x antennasThe sand consistency is very strange, it is solid when shaped but does run through your fingers as detailed in the attached photo. It is very easy to mould, my son had so much fun filling the moulds and turning them over to reveal the shape. He had a little competition from the adults to play with it so it really is for the whole family to enjoy. The sand as claimed creates little mess and is very easy to tidy as it sticks to itself. The amount of sand received means you can fill 8 of the 9 moulds at one time. I plan to purchase more as my son gets older ... his dad has already been browsing the range online.I highly recommend motion sand, so much fun with no tedious tidy up at the end.I hope this review was helpful. | Great Buy! // 5.0 // 3 April 2015 // By

 on 27 Oct. 2015 // This was £5.99 plus postage earlier in the year, and was an excellent contender to Kinetic Sand due to price and quality.  Fully planned to give as gifts this year, however the seller has gradually increased their price to what is now treble what they were initially selling for!  With this in mind I feel you're better off buying the real Kinetic Sand - the quality is slightly better, the price isn't much different and colours are much more appealing to children.

 on 20 Dec. 2014 // Our front door is not totally flat - it has a raised wood grain effect in it. This means the hook will not stick to for more than 10 seconds BUT there is a very simple solution to this problem. Just use a little gel around the edges and you will find the hook stays up fine. The gel I have used is not watwerproof so it may come down in the rain but if it does I have already decided I will use vaseline next time. Hope this is helpful.Review UPDATE - The hook is cream in colour and our front door is red so it looks odd. We decided therefore to fit the hook upside down on the inside of the door and hang the wreath on a red ribbon which goes over the top of the door and ties to the hook.This works brilliantly. But importantly, when I came to remove the hook from the front door, it was well and truly stuck on - it wouldn't have come off in any sort of weather. So the GEL IS AN EXCELLENT SOLUTION. But for the colour I would give the hook 5 stars. | Waste of time and money // 1.0 // 15 Dec. 2014 // By

Unfortunately after creating our pretty desing my daughter decided to shake the bottle and all the sand mixed up so it doesn't look so good. However, it's fun to do and the finished product can make great little presents for family or friends. Am actually considering buying another one. | Fab // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2014 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 29 Dec. 2014 // The kids really enjoyed making the sand bottles  in this kit.  The eight packets of coloured sand were plenty for them to use with the funnel and scoop it came with and they were easily able to make stripy patterns.  They didn't really use the supplied tool that fits into the bottle to mix up the sand but you could do this if you wanted to try different effects.Unlike other bottle art we've done before these seem to be quality - the plastic is thick enough so that the sand hasn't all mixed up into a mess of colour.There's rather a lot of packaging, but like every Melissa and Doug craft I've ever tried this kit is great quality, works and children love it.  I will be buying more for birthday presents for the 5-8 range I think as it's great value too. | excellent // 5.0 // 18 Mar. 2013 // By

 on 20 Dec. 2015 // I buy and send three Alison Gardiner every year for my grandchildren in Spain, an event they look forward to eagerly. Alison Gardiner calendars are amongst the very few that can be posted from the UK to the Continent.  My only negative comment is that choosing the calendars is not easy as the selection does not change sufficiently often to enable me to send three new, different designs each year. Apart from these two negative comments, I like these attractive and traditional calendars and recommend them without hesitation to UK and Continental buyers alike.

 on 4 Dec. 2015 // This is a lovely traditional picture advent calendar.  My boys have two different designs in this make and they had them last year too.  The numbers are clear enough for my four year old to find and they are interestingly placed rather than being in numerical order or all at the top.  The illustrations are nice too, both fit the main picture and for the ones behind the doors.I will be getting ones from this designer again next year | Great advent calendar // 5.0 // 8 Jan. 2016 // By

They looks nice so she is looking forward to find the dolly:).The negative thing is- for little hands is really hard to open those small doors every day so she needs my help and even for me its not easy.

 on 7 Dec. 2014 // Very disappointed with this calendar. Comparing it to my sons toy calendar, the items and overall look of this is poor in comparison and his only cost £5 more. The doll isn't availbsle till day 21 I think and so she is opening doors with items of clothing behind and no polly pocket doll. Luckily she has a doll that the clothes fit until she reveals rhe poly pocket one. That said she seems happy with it and I suppose that's what counts. | Very nice product // 5.0 // 26 Feb. 2014 // By

 on 30 Dec. 2014 // Never before have I seen my 5yr old be so eager to open a calendar, she loved it. I think the box could be designed differently maybe even change the plastic inside to black as once several doors had been opened it was quite easy to look in and see the awaiting gifts. The gifts were varied, from boots to dresses to a Christmas doughnut ""pet"" which again my daughter liked.

Considering the cost of playmobil in general we always think these advent calendars are great value. It takes a bit of time to set up as you get a flat piece of backing card with pictures on and then you make up the boxes which takes around 20 mins to put together and these slot on to the flat backing piece. The instructions tell you which piece of playmobil to put in which box. There is a cardboard 'set' which you then put your pieces on each day as you open them. We have had virtually all of them and I can't fault them and they then play with them alongside their other playmobil for the rest of the year.",""

 on 22 Jan. 2014 // I actually purchased this for a 3 year old and she loved the excitement of collecting the dolls clothes and accessories and then finally getting the doll on Christmas day. However the hat does not fit at all due to the doll's hairstyle. Also the clothes are really fiddly to put on, even for me and a couple have developed tiny tears. Overall though it brought a lot of fun each morning during advent. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 18 Sept. 2014 // By

 on 11 Sept. 2015 // I agree with previous reviews that say that this is extremely expensive for what you get. The front picture is very misleading as the amount of sand you actually get is about a quarter of what is pictured. I also bought my daughter a separate refill pack to bulk it out a bit which turned out to be a good  move. That said, it is the most fascinating stuff I have come across!

VINE VOICE on 2 Nov. 2014 // I was pretty disappointed with this product as it doesn't live up to the impression given by the box art.First off the tiny hand gives a false impression of size, this thing is less than a foot square, not the large looking tray depicted. Secondly, the tray in the photo is packed with sand, the box you receive bears small print  which advises that photo shows 2lb of sand, not the supplied 1lb, so that, not only is the tray small it is less than half full.The Kinetic sand itself is interesting stuff, and our boy has found it fun to play with, however the small size of the tray does mean the stuff escapes and unless you're vigilant can make a mess. The moulds  work well and the sand retains its shape and can even be shaped to a small degree in the hand, though unless it's supported will lose its shape quickly.On the subject of mess, I can't understand why a lid wasn't included, we've resorted to using a carrier bag to put the tray in but this isn't entirely suitable as if the box gets accidentally turned upside down it makes a bit of a mess.Something I didn't consider was the environmental impact of this stuff, when it gets into the environment, as it is polymer coated sand, I can't think of a suitable method of disposal; the tray and moulds are at least recyclable. Still thinking of the environment, it is worth noting the distances involved in the manufacture and transport of the components. The sand is made in Europe, the plastics in Canada, both are then shipped to Mexico to be assembled, before shipping back out before sale.Overall, there is potential for a good toy here, though I feel I've been deceived by misleading marketing. | Much smaller tray than it appears on the box. // 3.0 // 29 Nov. 2014 // By

That said, Kinetic Sand is good fun and our 3.5yr old really enjoys playing with it.

VINE VOICE on 21 Oct. 2014 // If you are impressed by the illustration on the box you will be disappointed with the actual contents!The moulds are tiny, not made from a very sturdy plastic and the sand is difficult to remove intact from the castle mould.You only get one colour, purple so to make play more interesting you will need to buy other colours from the range, personally I will not be doing that because the novelty has already worn off after an hour or so with a 4 year old who called the set ""silly"". Out of the mouths etc. etc.I really didn`t find the tray very useful because it is just over 20 mm deep and the sides are not even straight, thankfully I put a plastic tablecloth underneath. The kinetic sand is just okay, a bit funny to the touch but nothing special. I can see these moulds being used with Play dough more than anything else.Another small point is the packaging, it`s difficult enough to find anything in English on the box but when removing the tape from the side opening part of the instructions peeled of as well. I cannot justify the price for what you get here and do not recommend, sorry. | Great novelty toy // 5.0 // 22 Nov. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 22 Nov. 2015 // This is a good 'novelty' product for children who are perhaps more accustomed to more usual toys. It is certainly different and it has a real novelty value that is guaranteed to grab and hold their attention.The box contains a bag of sand, a tray and four moulds. The sand itself is basically sand mixed with a harmless polymer and a bright purple dye. The polymer makes the sand grains stick together slightly so if you pack it into a mould the sand holds the shape of the mould for a while. The adhesion gradually breaks down and the sand shape slowly falls apart into semi-loose grains again. It's a bit like playing with damp sand on the beach but the sand is more 'sticky' and the polymer helps give any moulded shape greater definition.The polymer itself is clean and odour-free. The sand has no distinct smell and it doesn't leave any sticky residue on your hands. It doesn't stick to carpets or solid surfaces or anything. If you do get any on the carpet you can just vacuum it up.The sand is coloured bright purple although you can buy lots of other colours separately if you want . For some reason the manufacturers chose bright purple as the standard colour to be used in the basic kit. In my opinion this was a questionable choice as some of the other more subtle colours are visually more appealing.You get one imperial pound  of sand in the box. This isn't very much and you will probably find yourself buying more separately. Additional sand is expensive; currently  over £12 for a random coloured one pound bag on Amazon and up to £25 for a one pound bag of specific coloured metallic sand. I would advise you to be aware you could easily end up spending more than you think buying more of this product to maintain its 'playability'.Read more ›",""

It's fine if the product is reasonably priced but it is pretty dear for what it is. | Perfect play sand with a unique texture and looks just like real sand // 5.0 // 16 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 16 Mar. 2016 // My son absolutely loves Kinetic Sand, it is so easy to mould, has a unique texture that retains it's shape when you make a mould with it.  he loves making little gold bars with this gold sand.  It's not as sparkling gold as on the packaging but it's still a nice shade, it looks a lot like real sand so it is the most realistic looking play sand that I've seen, you can make sandcastles with this that look like they're straight off the beach.  It doesn't stain your carpet and is easy to clear away, just scoop it up and put back in the bag, it retains it's soft texture.  If there are any spillages simply sweep them up or hoover them.  As it is so easy to use it is the perfect toy for children with sensory needs as it boosts their creativity and confidence.  Hours of fun with this play sand.

 on 19 Jan. 2015 // Fantastic quality, as with all playmobil products. A delight to open and discover what is behind each door.Some of the doors open to reveal toys that aren't exactly thrilling e.g. a fence/a sack of reindeer food. Although this is to be expected, playmobil could number the doors differently so that the less thrilling toys aren't one day after the other.Father Christmas is behind door number 24. It is a long wait... As Playmobil is a German company and German children celebrate St Nikolaus on 6th December, maybe that would be a more appropriate date for Father Christmas to appear? | playmobil for life not just xmas! // 5.0 // 3 Nov. 2014 // By

 on 12 Sept. 2011 // I bought this advent calendar a couple of weeks ago, having seen it on sale, and initially thought it was very lightweight for the price. I'm not a fan of the recent City Police theme , but the kids will probably like this calendar for the playability each model and minifigure brings.There are two models in the calendar that will be built over more than one day, and unlike last year's advent calendar you'll have to wait until each model is completed before you can effectively play with them.If your kids like City Police then this advent calendar is a great choice, otherwise it might be better to invest in another set. | Christmas Fun with Lego! // 5.0 // 5 Jan. 2012 // By

 on 5 Jan. 2012 // Having seen from other people enjoying this year's Lego City Advent Calendar and at less than £20, I couldn't resist to purchase this product.Having purchased and the product delivered on time for Christmas, Lego City Advent Calendar failed to disappoint, you get a LEGO police building, a LEGO police car, two snow mobile, 6 figurines including two police, two robbers, a fisherman and Santa with a dog. Using the advent calendar box as the backdrop, you can place the LEGO pieces on the cardboard part of the box, and can be enjoyed by friends and family opening the advent flaps counting to each day. So much so that I bought another one for next year already.I would strongly recommend this LEGO City Advent Calendar especially at the price of £15.15 from coolclearance! | Great Fun. // 5.0 // 21 Sept. 2011 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 31 Dec. 2012 // I bought this for an avid Lego fan .  It went down a lot better than a selection box and what is more, certainly more playable with.  The figures are so cute and the dinky looking dog, think that was my favourite of all.  Now this is the City range but like all Lego themed ones you can reuse these figures in any other combinations you wish .  You do not have to be a child to play with this Advent calendar just have some imagination and anything can be made.Lots of different mini figures that are contained in a cardboard cutout advent calendar.  Yes I did think that maybe the box could have been better designed, as it soon gets a dog eared look about it with it being just that cardboard.  I suppose that if the box was made of plastic or such the price would go up, but at the end of the day it is not just the packaging but the mini figures that you buy it for.  And the guessing of which figure it may be hiding behind which door.But compared to buying lots of mini figures it works out cheaper and a lot more healthier to the teeth than chocolate.  Plus the fun of guessing what is what is half the fun too.I did the stupid thing though of making it a Christmas present.  Should have made it an early one then the days could have be opened like a traditional advent calendar, rather than son wanting to start on Christmas Day then having to open all the previous day ones.  So best to give it as an early December the 1st present.I would buy another one but in a different range next time as son knows what is in this one so not as big surprise. | Lovely idea for older kids // 4.0 // 22 Dec. 2011 // By

 on 22 Dec. 2011 // I bought this advent calendar for my eldest son who is 4 1/2, thinking that we would have loads of fun building the scene up together day by day, and that I'd be able to bring it out again next year, and the next and the next in what would become a lovely family tradition.Er... no!The calendar does build into a nice scene, with a fisherman sitting by a fire fishing in the lake, and some christmas presents under the christmas tree, a skateboard with helmet etc. or a not so nice scene depending on the way you look at it, with bank robbers using a snowball flinging device to fend off the cops and keep themselves out of the jailhouse, and so on.  But the pieces are soooooo tiny, and so numerous it's impossible to avoid them getting lost , hoovered up or plain old eaten by my 18month old!  It's the 22nd of December today and we probably have about 200 tiny pieces of lego from this set in a tuperware box , and we've still got another couple of days to go!On a plus side, both my boys have loved making other things with the tiny lego bits.  My eldest makes really good space ships, and my 18month old enjoys experimenting with multiple head transplants stacked onto the baddie's body.  So they've had loads of entertainment from this toy - just not the sort I had originally planned, but then again, I should know better by now.  And I think when it's used like this -  to make different things - it is quite educational.  But is it durable - I'm afraid not.Read more ›",""

 on 16 Mar. 2016 // I purchased this box of Kinetic Sand for my 7 year old son as he likes to play in the sand and this is perfect for indoor play without making  mess .  He absolutely loves it.  The sand has a unique texture in that unlike real sand, it retains it's shape so you can make moulds of it very easily and it stays in that shape as long as you want it to.The inflatable tray is a great idea as it gives it a beach like quality - you can almost imagine you are playing with sand on the beach.  The only thing is I left it inflated all night and my kitten must have punctured it so now I cannot re-inflate it but I still use it as a play mat.  The set comes with 4 large bags of sand, 10 mounds, 2 cylinder makers and a couple of handy cutters, together with a pump to inflate the play mat.The sand is high quality, I have used the original Kinetic Sand before and this is of comparable quality, if anything it is slightly easier to mould as it has a firmer texture.  My son has sensory needs and therefore he is not keen on messy play but he has absolutely no problems at all making things with this sand and using the moulds, even with limited  fine motor skills, he makes the moulds perfectly and is really pleased with himself which boosts his confidence and self esteem, it's nice to find a creative toy that is so easy to use.  I would recommend this to any child with sensory needs as the texture is soothing to them in the same way as thera-putty but with this you can be much more creative with all the different shapes e.t.c .  My son loves me helping him make things too and we build walls together using the wall mould and then make little animals to put inside of the walls.  He enjoys spending quality time with me playing sand and showing me what he can build.Read more › | If normal sand and play doh had a love child... // 4.0 // 2 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 18 Feb. 2016 // I've seen kinetic sand a few times on the internet. I knew my daughter  would love it and I was interested to see the claim of 'no mess' first hand. We have a sand pit in the garden but never get to use it due to the weather. It also makes a mess and she gets covered in it.We were both excited when the Wizard sand was delivered. I appreciate any toy that comes with its own storage box and I think the inflatable sided tray is a really good idea to keep the sand contained. The pump was pretty useless and broke instantly revealing little parts and a tiny ball bearing. It went straight in the bin. It isn't really needed since it took less than a minute to blow up with lung power. Now if you're paying full whack for this kit a cheap plastic pump that doesn't work is going to be pretty disappointing.The sand itself comes stored in resealable bags. Only the cheap type you can buy in abundance from shops but still, it's nice for packaging to not be wasted. You get 4 x 500g. I checked out some other kits out of interest. This set Kinetic Sand Box Set contains a cat litter type tray and must only include 400g of sand since with the tray and 4 moulds the entire box weighs 490g for £20. So 4 x the amount of sand and lots of molds and tools in the Wizard kit is pretty good.There are plenty of molds but these are only cheap plastic. I have tons of these lying around anyway so you'd need to ask yourself whether you can do without 10 molds and lots of tools when you could just find these lying around and buy the sand on its own for less money.My daughter loved the sand. It is a really impressive product on its own.Read more ›",""

 on 11 Nov. 2015 // Because the sand doesn't stain and is non-toxic, it is perfect for being able to play with indoors during the winter when you can't get to the beach to make proper sandcastles!I did find it relatively mess free and, any mess that was made could be swept up easily though I will only let my children play with it in the dining room where there is no carpet.I liked that the set had a good sized tray included to play with the sand.  There was plenty of space in the trays to make plenty of sculptures and still left plenty of space for them to play with the sand.  I would have liked to have seen lids for the trays to be able to store the sand easier.The quality of the plastic modelling tools provided is great.  The plastic is strong and will stand up to a lot of play.Although Sands Alive claims to look and feel like real sand I don't really agree.  It definitely feels more like a modelling sand than real sand which is not a bad thing.  It does, however, look more like sand than other sets we have had in the past as it is sand coloured.My 7 year old son found the sand very easy to model both with his hands and with the moulds provided.  My 3 year old daughter struggled a little, though still had fun playing with the sand.The sand came out of the moulds very easily and I was really impressed with how much detail was imprinted onto the sand.Once my son had made the sculptures they did stay standing until he knocked them down to pack the sand away.  The sand does stick together very well.For the price, I think the set is excellent value for money.  You receive plenty of sand and a lot of moulds to play with.Read more › | Was expecting something closer to moon sand which is a far superior 'sand ' The only thing - my 3 yr ... // 3.0 // 30 Dec. 2015 // By

I discard this layer when giving as a gift so the recipient doesn't  know what to expect behind each window.  If it is opened carefully, there is no evidence of this.Underneath, on one side of the box is a tree-framed, snowy scene with a path meandering off into the distance with an inbuilt hanger to put on a wall, if required.  If just standing the calendar on a flat surface, which is quite successful due to its depth, the hanger just looks like the moon in the wintry night sky and doesn't spoil the scene.On the other side are the advent calendar windows, showing Santa & his elves, busy with preparations and loading the sleigh, watched over by an angel.  The windows vary in sizes and the numbers are easy to spot, each surrounded by a bright yellow star.  They are relatively easy to open, by depressing and pushing back on the tab, and then tear the perforations.  The rewards occasionally need basic assembling, adding to the fun.The contents are designed to go on the colourful backdrop - the base of which measures around 46 cm maximum x 24.Read more › | She was absolutely delighted when I gave it to her on 30th November ... // 5.0 // 23 Jan. 2015 // By

 on 29 Dec. 2015 // My sister made me an advent calendar back in 2004 out of matchboxes, papier mache and the Playmobil nativity sets, after all this time it is getting rather battered and loved but my two young children adore it. I was delighted to discover Playmobil made their own calendars a few years ago but at the time the price was out of my range and I didn't think it looked like you got much inside for the price. How wrong was I! On the spur of the moment I ordered this the last week of November, my husband was not impressed when he realized I had spent nearly £25 on an advent calendar/Seasonal toy. However when it arrived one look on the back of the box swayed him. Note: Don't let the recipients of the calendar see the back of the box for it shows you what you receive behind each door! Each door holds something for Santa's workshop, e.g a blue basket with six teeny tiny animal figures , a wheelbarrow and teddy bear, carrots for the reindeer, a ""present"" with toy racing car. There are four little card boxes behind various doors which you need to fold up into presents. This advent calendar comes with four figures - An angel, two elves and Santa himself , all hidden behind a different door. Inside the box there is a beautiful cardboard backdrop, you have to pop out some parts and fold it to make it stand. It really is gorgeous and the children loved setting up the scene each day. The card game you get is just a little box with a simple game of snap  inside. I think my children would have preferred an extra toy for the grotto but it is a nice idea. I will definitely be buying these annually. The excitement on my bairns faces each morning was wonderful and something you would not be able to get from a chocolate calendar. Plus they have a beautiful toy to get out every Christmas. | We all loved it. Bit tricky keeping all the bits together ... // 5.0 // 31 Dec. 2014 // By

The doors are quite firm so smaller kids need a bit of effort to open them. I had to open the door for my 3 year old to break the perforations then close it for her to open in the morning. As I have all the bits, it may be back again next year and I can mix up all the pieces for them. I will be looking to see what other ones there are too.",""

 on 11 Jun. 2015 // We were sent this in return for our honest review.The set is aimed at children aged 4 and above which I would agree with.  It is not something I would let my two year old daughter play with yet as I know she would become bored easily and end up making a mess instead!When the set arrived I didn't think it looked like there was much sand in the bag to play with, however, once tipped into the tray there was plenty there to keep my son happy.He got stuck straight in, squeezing the sand together and moulding it into shapes.  He enjoyed using the roller and tools, however, I felt there could have been a couple of moulds included to keep his attention for longer.  These can be bought separately but it would be nice to have one or two included in this set.I was happy to let my 6 year old son play with the sand indoors as it is fairly mess free.  Although he wasn't always careful to keep the sand in the play tray, what he did spill on the table was easy to clean back up into tray and I didn't find that any stuck to the furniture or the floor.I was impressed with the quality of the play tray and tools provided and feel the set provides good value for money.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the sand fit back into the bag provided with little effort as that saved me having to have an extra storage tub - everything fits back into the box provided.Overall we are pleased with the Cra-Z-Sand Deluxe Play set and would definitely recommend it as a fun way to play with sand relatively mess free! | Fun! // 5.0 // 8 Jun. 2015 // By

VINE VOICE on 8 Jun. 2015 // Cra-Z sand is a lot of fun. It's pretty similar to kinetic sand, and sands alive in the way that it molds and moves. It is less messy than normal play sand since it sticks together differently and you won't get little sand grains all over the house, so if you are playing indoors then this is better.The set includes enough cra-z sand to play with  and a tray to use while playing, plus a couple of tools like a roller and shaper but not any molds for making sandcastles or shapes. You can use any of your own sand molds though or even a cup, they will all work fine and this cra-z sand molds really well, keeping its shape better than normal sand. It is quite similar to moon sand or moon dough in the way that it moldsMy children all enjoy playing with this, ages 3, 5 and 6 | Where's the Pyramid? // 1.0 // 27 Mar. 2016 // By

 on 27 Mar. 2016 // Not happy with this purchase. My daughter was keen to sculpt pyramids and walls and the box clearly shows these, with a vague description of 1 tray, 1 roller and 3 shaping tools.The three shapes sand sculptures on the front  are photographed with the tray and roller. There is no disclaimer next to these stating moulds not included.A separate image of a fish mould has a small disclaimer of no mould included. This is unacceptable and bad marketing.The included tools are all flat and the included instructions describe how to fill a mould NOT INCLUDED and use the shapers to clean the sand away.I am not impressed! There should be a clear label on the front of the box that the shapes are not included.1.5lb of sand, a cat litter tray and three bits of flat plastic are sadly not worth the money.I would send this back immediately, but unfortunately the Easter Bunny bought it and my daughter opened the product. She was disappointed that the pyramid was missing, I'll now have to look for one online. | Beware, the quantity is not what you would expect for the price // 3.0 // 12 Jan. 2016 // By

All of this will go with my son's other lego kingdoms sets & he loves it. The lego city one in Dec2009 was good value too and packed with some really nice bits! Good advice from another reviewer- grab one for next year in the upcoming January sales. | Brilliant // 5.0 // 20 Dec. 2010 // By

EACH DAYS WINDOW CONCEALS EITHER A FIGURE, WEAPON OR MINI MODEL TO MAKE WHICH COMPILES TO FORM A SCENARIO ON A BASE IN FRONT OF THE CALENDER.MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO GET ONE HALF PRICE IN DEC/JAN SALES AND SAVE FOR NEXT YEAR!! | lego is king // 5.0 // 2 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 26 Dec. 2015 // The sand is rubbish - very messy and doesn't stick together. It's more like flour than sand.

 on 12 Feb. 2016 // This was a fabulous purchase for my 4 year old, he absolutely loves it and has played for hours with it. It is a pliable 'dough like'  sand which can be used with moulds and stamps to create castles or anything else your child can think of.  It comes with a good selection of moulds, a roller and a couple of stamps to help create pretty cool looking castles as per the box!The sand itself is excellent. There were two large packs in the box and it does not dry out as claimed  by the manufacturer.Overall this was an excellent gift for my son! He loves sand and 'play doh'  and since this is like those two things mixed together, it is ideal!My only concern when buying was the mess it would probably make and while it does come with a reasonably large tray, the sand does get everywhere. It is however pretty easy to clean up, because it doesn't dry out, it also doesn't embed in your carpets. It takes a little more hoovering   it does clean up well. On tables and chairs it can just be wiped off back into the tray. It leaves and off residue in your hands also but this is removed with washing.I did find that there wasn't anything I could really do with the sand once my son had finished playing with it but I found a plastic tupperwear box that it fit into perfectly.I do think however that the product would be even better if the tray doubled as a sealable box, i imagine it wouldn't take much to refashion the tray so that it could support a lid.Even with storage issue, it is an excellent product and my son loves it! We are hoping to try out the other moulds in other packs soon! | A bit messy // 3.0 // 7 April 2016 // By

 on 7 April 2016 // The manufacturer must have changed the chemical composition of this powder  because it is a nightmare... when it gets in the carpet it's difficult to get out. This stuff doesn't perform at all like it's supposed to , it doesn't stick to itself as claimed but it does stick to fabrics with an alarming persistence, as my wife's skirt still bears witness. I couldn't even get it out of the carpet with a vacuum cleaner, I had to rub it with a brush first and even then it still needed the pet hair attachment of the vacuum cleaner before it came out . If I seem annoyed about this product it's because I am, it's taken me ½ hour so far to try cleaning up after this laughably claimed 'no mess' modelling sand'.I can only compare the residue this Sands Alive makes to that of plaster of Paris and although the sand material is not as fine it embeds itself in fabrics just as much. In the carpet, cushions and clothes, all of which needed cleaning afterwards. It even gets under the fingernails... my son drinks out of a plastic tumbler and all around outside was covered in a dried powdery residue,  and that was easy to clean.This is the second Sands Alive set we've bought in the last fortnight, the first was the animal set, John Adams Sands Alive Animal Set reviewed separately, and neither of them perform at all like the squidgy sand in the promo videos; there is no clumping and no self-binding.Read more ›",""

 on 1 Oct. 2015 // I bought two of these while they were on sale, half price. I'm sure my daughters are going to be over the moon with them :) they look better than what I expected, much bigger and come with a really good variety of playmobil. You get 3 figures, a throne, a selection of animals such as a deer, some rabbits, some foxes, a badger, a peacock, a unicorn, a butterfly and loads more. There doesn't seem to be too many rubbish little bits, which I was worried about as I'm sure my daughters won't appreciate opening one of the doors to find a flower or a piece of grass! I also like how there are 2 of certain animals but by the looks of it they come together on a certain day . | Great alternative to Choc calendar! // 5.0 // 30 July 2014 // By

    April Wallis
  
 on 19 Feb. 2013 // This jedi star fighter is nearly a tenner more than the Plo Koon set, or the Mace Windu set from a few years ago, but having built it, it is actually BIGGER and more sophisticated than these earlier models, so that explains the price. I guess as Saesee Tinn is an ace jedi pilot, he naturally gets a bigger ship.It comes with 2 instruction books, as there are enough pieces to split the build into 2 parts. Our 7 year old has built the first instruction books worth with very few errors on his own - so not such a tricky build for this age group, but tricky enough to still remain a challenge. The cockpit detaches as an escape pod, so that also explains the 2 part build.Compared to the other star fighters, it looks really cool. It has several moving parts, landing gear, cockpit cover and flick missiles. It is still smaller than the super dooper size models and as such has great swooshing potential, without too much risk of falling apart. I really like the size of these star fighter models, as they will fit easily into a plastic storage box or onto a shelf for display.Comes with 3 collectable mini guys . There are 2 great jedi from the clone wars plus the green astromech R5 D5. Even Piell - the one with the big floppy ears and eye patch, is unique to this set and Saesee Tinn - the one with horns, is only available in 2 other expensive sets. . So all in all worth the little extra cost. | Lego Star Wars kit // 5.0 // 12 Jan. 2013 // By

 on 20 Nov. 2012 // A fun little piece with some minifigures that I haven't seen elsewhere, so if that's what interests you then I'd recommend buying this one.The build isn't TOO complicated, so if you're wanting a complex and interesting build, this one might not be for you. However, if you're looking for a smaller piece to display, then this one fits in quite nicely. Especially since the landing gear means it sits quite nicely on a shelf.In terms of playing with it, there's a decent amount it can do for its size. It has the usual flick missiles, and a place to hold the lightsabers when the Jedi is in flight, and there's even an escape pod with this one, so there are a few scenarios you can set up with it.Overall, not my favourite piece since I like complex and interesting builds, however it's a welcome addition to my collection and I think it would be fun for a younger builder to play with. | This is the Starship you are looking for // 5.0 // 29 Sept. 2015 // By

 on 1 Dec. 2014 // Excellent product that works very well.  I purchased this for my 5 year old and he and his older brother have used it a lot.  It sticks well together, and I consider the materials added to be safe for my children.One challenge is where to store the sand - it's for indoors play but it can still make a mess on the carpet.  If bits fall on the carpet, the larger bits can be picked up but the small bits need the vacuum cleaner to come round.  We have used a large biscuit tin to store it in, but unless the kids play in a very tranquil way they end up spilling over onto the carpet.  I've made an order for a mixing tray to solve that problem:  MIXING TRAY, CHILDREN'S PLAY MAT, SAND PIT, WATER, PLASTIC, TOYS, POOL PIT, Update:  I decided to purchase a second kinetic sand pack for Christmas since I'm buying a mixing tray which gives extra playing space.  At the time of writing there are two sellers, in-stock seller at £33 and Amazon out of stock at £15.  I purchased the out of stock Amazon one on 6 December 2014 and received it just a few days later on 11 December 2014.  However it is still showing out of stock on Amazon today .

You build the display piece by piece  and they can play with it too :o). I wouldn't advise it for people with small children in the house though because there are lots of small part which could get swallowed.It does take a long time to set up so prepare to spend an hour or so working out which part is what and then packing them into the tiny cardboard boxes... playmobil could have made it much easier if they had bothered.

Honestly!!! I bought this with the intention of giving it to my son. And I did - eventually. It arrived at work, I opened it and then I accidentally opened the box and opened day 1. At this point, I just couldn't do it and ended up keeping it for the month of December.It ended up being a good work reward for my team - whom ever had done a good job got the pleasure of opening the next window and assembling the toy.

 on 9 Nov. 2015 // Arrgh I love Lego and find myself giving this a 2 star rating, this pains me. The reason for this is I honestly feel that Lego are short changing us with this years calendar. We have only got 2 figures and as lovely as they are the Lego City and the Lego Star wars calendars both have more, but even more unforgivably there is no Santa figure- What are you thinking Lego- Christmas without the big man??Some of the models in this are too pink and twee- just because it is aimed at girls do we really have to have a pink skadoo?Some models are great, but I want to see microscopes and stethoscopes rather than a hair brush and hair dryer.Come on Lego don't short change the girls, give us a Santa and the message that we are worth more than pretty hair and singing and dancing next year. | Come on Lego give us Santa // 3.0 // 9 Nov. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWER on 9 Nov. 2015 // This is a great idea for an advent calendar, it is unashamedly aimed at little girls who like to build and generally play with Lego  and the little windows each hold a complete model to build each day.Some of these are very small and in all honesty just fillers with the star of the show being the little dolls, I think that there should have been a Lego Santa in here - which there isn't. It seems ridiculous for him to be missing at Christmas, especially since there is a Lego Santa in the Lego city advent calendar and a Lego C3Po dressed up in a Santa Suit in the Lego starwars advent calendar. The scene that this builds in really sweet and there is even online additional games for you to ""unlock"" as the month progresses  This year I have bought 3 Lego advent calendars- Star Wars, City and this one and I can honestly say that for the best value for money and models the Lego City calendar  wins it hands down in my opinion. | Build and play all the way to Christmas // 5.0 // 6 Sept. 2015 // By

 on 6 Sept. 2015 // Lego releases 3 different versions of their Advent Calendar each year, and this Friends model is the ""girly"" one. As usual there are lots of fun mini-models to assemble and place on the box's play area, including 2 dolls. Whether you buy the City, Friends, or Star Wars version of the advent calendar set, you'll have fun counting down the days in December all the way to Christmas!This is the 2015 model from Lego---they release new advent calendars every year---but it's simply designated for days 1-24 so you could use any of the sets from year to year. To re-use the calendar, make sure you carefully pop open the perforated windows so you'll be able to re-close them for next time. Buy early, Lego sells out of these calendars quickly! | Good but last years was better // 4.0 // 1 Jan. 2016 // By

I think last years was better as there were a few things this year that were a bit naff.2 recommendations firstly buy a big base to clip everything on to else you end up with lot of little bits getting lost. Secondly before you throw the box away tear off the doors as these have the building pictures and come in handy next year when you want to rebuild the broken things. | Lots of play value // 5.0 // 6 Dec. 2015 // By

My two girls  are sharing it ad enjoying it - and both playing with it.We've never had  one before, but the thing I didn't get from the product photos is that all the pieces build towards a scene: the front of the box folds down to make a skating tableau. Then, all the bits add to the play.I'd definitely think about one next year, at least for the younger one | Great Advent calendar to keep children amused all December and beyond. // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2015 // By

It is fascinating the way the sand 'moves' after you put it down after you have been moulding it in your hands.

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 3 Nov. 2011 // If you buy one thing for your child leading up to Christmas then I suggest you buy one of these. They are great fun, durable and well worth the money. Behind each door is a playmobil item, some of them larger others small, but they all belong to one set or subject. For instance the Dragon calendar has a  dragon and Knights with horses. The sets that emerge from the doors are actually much more expensive if you buy the items in a single playmobil packet. | Good improvement on a great toy // 5.0 // 2 Dec. 2010 // By

 on 19 Jan. 2012 // This is an excellent idea,it is the first time I have bought a non chocolate advent calender and I will be doing it again next year.My son was so excited when he saw this as he has a few of the Playmobil knight sets and really wanted a dragon to go with it. He enjoyed waiting to see what he would get each day-he would try and guess what he would get every night before he went to bed.I would have liked the calendars to be more Christmassy but most of the chocolate ones are not Christmas theamed either.These advent calendars are much more expensive than the chocolate ones but the toys have been played with daily since being opened so I can't really complain about it. | Excellent calender // 5.0 // 3 Dec. 2011 // By

 on 21 Dec. 2010 // This Advent calendar has been a massive success.Our 3 and half year old son has been keen on Playmobile for the last 6 to 8 months so this was going to be a natural choice for the budding soldier/buzz lightyear/policeman fan. After the first few days of opening the doors and building up the knights collection of armour and weapons, we let our him see what was still to come by talking through the pictures on the back of the covering box.Our son has had a great time playing with the card 'castle' that comes with the calendar and I have been able to explain to him the educational side of what helmets were for and why the horses wear protective clothing.The highlight of the month has been the red, fire breathing dragon !! I wish that I had one of those when I was a child..While some days are a little less inspiring , the bigger toys make it all worthwhile. As we know, Playmobile characters are built to last so no amount of jousting or sword play will damage them.For the price, an educational and for once non chocolate based calendar! Great buy and worth seeing the smiles each day a new door is opened. | Best advent calendar ever // 5.0 // 23 Dec. 2011 // By

But he has totally loved it and has played with it though the whole of december.  He wasnt allowed to open a window till he found the number and he has created many stories around the characters.

 on 6 Dec. 2015 // The Kinetic sand came before time, but the box is a lot smaller than what it looks like in the advertised picture, it does seem expensive for what it is basically after carful opening of the box, just a bag of kinetic sand, no castle shape mould  or any other shape mould don't be fooled by the cover if the box, so that is an extra expense for moulds, I am shure my 10 year old Daughter will love it for Christmas,  It needs no adult constant supervision unless you have a younger child that wants to try and eat it, you need to invest as well in what I would suggest in a brand new cheap cat litter tray or similar tray for it to be played with in as this set doesn't come with a tray as others do. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 22 Jun. 2015 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 9 Oct. 2014 // New for 2014, the Lego Friends advent calendar is an excellent set, with 24 mini models to create.The are two minifigures included - Mia and Ewa - along with festive regulars such as a Christmas tree, sled, deer and fireplace, plus a Christmas dinner theme, with food, plates, glasses, a cooker and some decorations.A nice build up to Christmas, which model that can then be used all year round.As usual with the Lego advent calendars, the models are fiddly to make, and smaller children will need some hel.The other new advent calendars this year are Lego Star Wars and Lego City, and if you have a household full of Lego fans, you will probably do what I did and buy all three!There are lots of deals to be had on these advent calendars, and it pays to shop around. | Expensive but very enjoyable // 4.0 // 19 Dec. 2014 // By

 on 19 Dec. 2014 // I have to say that I was very dubious about spending what is quite frankly a lot of money on small amounts of lego . That said I consoled myself with the thought in my mind that this would be something I would count as an early Christmas present. It has been really nice to see my daughter opening this each morning rather than the usual chocolate version and she has enjoyed putting bits together and seeing her collection build. It is nice that they have some super simple bits to put together as well as a few bits that are moderately more challenging.

 on 12 Nov. 2013 // I bought last year's Moshi Monster advent calendar, so when I told my 9 year old there was a Micro Moshi one this year she smiled very sweetly at me!!!!It is clearly marked this year where to open it to reveal the advent doors, but saying that I didn't think last year's one was that hard to work out.I have a very excited daughter who can't wait for 1st December to come.I think it is great value at £10 for 24 Micro Moshis, I originally saw it priced at £16 so snapped it up when it was reduced to £10.Delivery as usual great.If you have a Moshi fan then I would highly recommend it. | Twistmas comes but once a year // 5.0 // 29 Sept. 2013 // By

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 29 Sept. 2013 // We enjoyed Moshi Monsters Moshi Advent Calendar last year and so I purchased the micro version for this year.  I've had a bit of a sneaky look inside and know the kids are going to love it.As befits their micro status, the micro advent calendar is a bit more compact  and like its larger brother the front folds down to reveal 24 doors each with a special edition micro-moshling and code for an item on the online site behind them.I assume the manufacturers have taken on board some of the comments about last year's calendar, there's a big labelled sticker to remove so you can open the front to avoid confusion and the micro moshlings are better secured in the casing so they are not going to fall out of their compartment, and also you can get an idea of what you are going to get on the back.  It's stands up fine.Inside, the 24 micro moshlings are the same size as the collectable ones and similar quality.  Most of them are in shades of festive red and green , and the special Christmas ones feature micro moshlings such as Iggy as a Christmas tree and Peppy with a Christmas bell on his head - if your kids are into Moshi they'll know what this means.  My pack doesn't contain exactly what is on the photo so there's still some surprise potential, I think I will be hiding the picture on the back from the kids though somehow.Overall, given that you get 24 figures  this is fair value, and I think more exciting than the chocolate calendars.  I would recommend it for die hard Moshi fans, though if you haven't had one before the one with the larger Moshlings in is possibly a slightly better buy, even more plastic for your money. | Value for money // 5.0 // 15 Nov. 2013 // By

She was very happy with it as she got a micro moshi figure  and a code to use online everyday.Because the calendar was almost half the r.r.p online it meant that it was an economical way for my daughter to boost her collection of Micro moshis and it was something she was genuinely excited about opening. | advent calander CUTE // 5.0 // 6 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 29 Nov. 2015 // Awful stuff; doesn't stick together but it does stick to clothes. And the only way to get it back out of the carpet is to vacuum it up... which defeats the purpose We live in quite a small apartment so before buying this living sand we checked it out quite thoroughly on the internet first  e.g, we watched a comparison on YouTube called ""6 Sand Comparison!"" it's about 1/2 hour long, plus a ""Sands Alive Starter Kit Opening & Review"" and both of them show Sands Alive product with very different properties . Anyway, we needed a sand that would clump together for indoor use and opted for the Sands Alive brand as it gave the broadest appeal.Sadly, the 'sand' in the package acts nothing like the sand in any of the videos, it's not dried out but it virtually acts as if it is; unlike being dough-like it acts as if it's the raw ingredients for making dough and yes, it makes just as much mess. In fact it's worse, as at least flour comes out of clothes simply by dusting off, but this Sands Alive stuff only comes out by being put through the washing machine.It was still fun for our 4-year old to play with but then again, cleaning is not one of his duties yet.The batch codes on the bag with sand are: 15010596 + 15010736The only positive I can say about this experience is that the retailer, Fun Filled Toys UK, was excellent; very helpful and provided a swift refund. | One Star // 1.0 // 22 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 24 Mar. 2016 // Because the sand doesn't stain and is non-toxic, it is perfect for being able to play with indoors during the winter when you can't get to the beach to make proper sandcastles!I did find it relatively mess free and, any mess that was made could be swept up easily though I will only let my children play with it in the dining room where there is no carpet.I liked that the set had a good sized tray included to play with the sand.  There was plenty of space in the trays to make plenty of sculptures and still left plenty of space for them to play with the sand.  I would have liked to have seen lids for the trays to be able to store the sand easier.The quality of the plastic modelling tools provided is great.  The plastic is strong and will stand up to a lot of play.Although Sands Alive claims to look and feel like real sand I don't really agree.  It definitely feels more like a modelling sand than real sand which is not a bad thing.  It does, however, look more like sand than other sets we have had in the past as it is sand coloured.My 7 year old son found the sand very easy to model both with his hands and with the moulds provided.  My 3 year old daughter struggled a little, though still had fun playing with the sand.The sand came out of the moulds very easily and I was really impressed with how much detail was imprinted onto the sand.Once my son had made the sculptures they did stay standing until he knocked them down to pack the sand away.  The sand does stick together very well.For the price, I think the set is excellent value for money.  You receive plenty of sand and a lot of moulds to play with.Read more › | Could do a lot better! // 1.0 // 16 Dec. 2015 // By

 on 23 Nov. 2015 // Kinetic sand is a good 'novelty' product for toddler who are perhaps more accustomed to more usual toys.We got this kinetic sand box set after seeing some in a shop on holiday, And we found that it's much cheaper online!  The kinetic sand feel great, which is quite soft. It's strangely addictive but the fact that it sticks to itself means its not too messy to have on a desk or coffee table and spillages can be cleaned up quite easily with more sand.Kinetic sand itself is clean and odour-free. The sand has no distinct smell and it doesn't leave any sticky residue on your hands. It doesn't stick to carpets or solid surfaces or anything. If you do get any on the carpet you can just vacuum it up.This product to be a good novelty toy for children. It is 'different' and it is guaranteed to get their attention and hold their interest for a while. It encourages early creativity and fires their imagination. | Moulds so easy allowing you to see the features of the moulds // 5.0 // 22 Jan. 2016 // By

Moulds so easy allowing you to see the features of the moulds. It doesn't leave sand particle all over the place as normal sand does. Better than play dough. I find it a bit expensive but considering the ease of using this it is well worth the money.

It is quite dinky  and looks lovely on a shelf. It is also well made and doesn't look cheap or rough.The owl is also a delight as it isn't a generic 'brown owl' and actually has some features of the tawny.I have used it every day since purchase and find it helps me remember the date much better than before because I have to constantly change it. It would also be a good educational toy for children who struggle to remember days or months.The great thing about it is that it will never expire or be superfluous.

 on 30 Dec. 2012 // We bought this for our 3 1/2 year old son and he loved every day opening up the window and getting a toy to add to the scene.  As he had a chocolate advent calendar that we used appropriately for days he  made the decision to just enjoy this and not open it up in date order.  Each day contained a toy ranging from a traffic cone that could be used at an accident through to figures and bikes.  For most of December he used the ready made scene that came with it and then the figures began to join in with his others in alternative activities and the scene went by the wayside.  Either way it was great value for money . I've given it 4/5 stars for educational value as it can be educational if that's how you make it; for durability I've given it 5 stars for the figures alone but the scene itself isn't durable.  We'll definitely be on the look out for this for 2013. | Imaginext never fail // 5.0 // 8 Dec. 2013 // By

 on 25 Feb. 2016 // My daughter was given this as a present at Christmas and she thought it was a lovely idea.  She finally got around to using this at the weekend and has made some beautiful looking creations that she has in pride of place next to her bed.  She has asked for another one for her birthday and also some as birthday pressies for her friends who love what she has shown them.  They kept her quiet for quite a time thinking about how the colours would look best and then finally creating her masterpieces.  The only slight gripe was that the sand settled overnight leaving a gap at the top of each of the bottles and she didn't have any sand left to top them up.  Over time when they get knocked over, they are now going to lose that initial design. | More sand please // 4.0 // 10 Mar. 2016 // By

    Mrs. J. P. Thomas
  
 on 30 Nov. 2011 // I've just put this advent calendar together.  Having read the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for the fact that a bit of time would be required to put the calendar together, but felt compelled to add to what has already been said.  Last year I got the Playmobil animals of the forest advent calendar, where no preparation was required as all of the toys were already in the windows which simply needed popping open each day.For this design whilst there is a fair bit of preparation, however I'm sure that the boxes are easier for children to open than we experienced with the window design.  If your child doesn't damage the boxes and is willing to let you put the contents away  this advent calendar can be re-used next December if you so wish.There are 24 flat packed boxes each of which have to be filled with the particular items to gradually build your princess scene.  The boxes were packed in batches relating to where they appear on the calendar, but the instructions for what goes into each of the boxes is in numerical order, so I would advise that you sort the boxes into numerical order before you start.The items which are required to go into the boxes are also packed in little batches, but from my experience this did not particularly ease the process of sussing out what went where, most especially as there are quite a number of tiny flowers which go into various boxes, so I would agree that the best approach is to open everything up and work from there.Each box hangs from the advent calendar by use of a flap on the calendar and a flap on the box - make sure that you pop each flap on the boxes out before you close each lid!Read more › | much better than chocolate! // 4.0 // 8 Dec. 2009 // By

 on 3 Jan. 2013 // Really loved this Advent Calendar... the whole Country House theme was wonderful. It was exciting to open each window as the pictures were so detailed. Each picture corresponded to the area of the house too .... so you had the maid and butler below stairs bringing the food and drinks... and the children in the attic getting ready for Santa etc.A brilliant concept and we will be keeping it to put up next year as it looks just as good now all the doors have been opened! | Wonderful traditional advent calendar // 5.0 // 26 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 26 Dec. 2012 // The whole family just loved this advent calendar.  The picture was beautiful and the pictures inside the doors show the people who live in the house preparing for Christmas.  My children had their usual calendars containing toys and chocolate, so I bought this calendar for me.  By Christmas Eve, all agreed that my calendar was the best.  I particularly loved seeing how captivated my children were by the images and how much they anticipated each new picture. It was also fantastic value for money.  We will be looking to purchase another Alison Gardiner advent calendar next year. | Excellent advent! // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2012 // By

 on 9 Mar. 2015 // This model is amazing! It is, without a doubt, the best pre-built, die-cast metal model I have ever seen. Forget Dinky! It is very heavy, and the level of detail is superb, right down to the pipes and cables in the engine bay, along with the highly-detailed TRD Group A Touring Spec AE101 '93 Silvertop 20v 4A-GELU engine, the working steering, rubber tyres, and bonnet, tailgate and doors which all open. The rear-view mirrors have mirrors in them; the clocks and dials on the dash  have the clock dials imprinted on them. There is carpet on the floors and in the boot space, and the driver's bucket seat is faithfully reproduced; there are even seat belts! The lights are very detailed, and the headlamps pop up! The logos  on the front, back and drivers door, are not transfers or decals; they appear to be incorporated into the paint somehow, but you can't see or feel the join; remarkable! The only omission is the lack of number plates , but they are easy enough to print and stick on - see my attempt in the attached photos.It's a pity AUTOart only do this model, and Keisuke's Mazda RX-7 Type R , from 'Initial D'; I would have liked to see more from the series, but aside from that, I have no complaints at all. A fantastic model!",""

I have a couple of dozen or so, including this Hennessey, which my girlfriend gave to me one year as a present. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following in common. They are exacting in the attention to detail, both exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching.I bought my first AutoArt model about five years ago and it still looks as good as the day I opened the packaging. The Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cloth if you're dusting and get damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once . The best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet, free from dust. You can buy a suitable display case for this model, either from Amazon, or else from the MiniModels website.I take great pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home, which now includes a couple of Porsche 911's, a Bugatti Veyron, Koenigsegg CCX, Pagani Huayra, and a couple of Ferrari 599's. Of all of my collection, I think that the orange coloured Koenigsegg CCX is probably the most stunning, you might want to take a look at one on the MiniModels website if it's not currently available from Amazon.It's always worth price-checking between the Amazon and MiniModels websites, if you're looking to buy a high quality diecast vehicle.Thank you for taking the time to read this review.",""

 on 21 Feb. 2010 // This is a strong and appealing toy for any child with a passion for cars and the transportation of them.  Providing you keep it on the ground.  But what child doesn't want to lift it up and carry it around.  This is when the lever disengages and the cabin comes away from the transport section.  It is quite tricky for a four year old to put it back and understand the concept that transporters must remain and be re-hooked, on the ground.  This also applies to turning corners, the transporter doesn't make it in one go the tendency is for the child to lift up the cabin section and turn it more - again the transporter comes unhooked.  Despite this it was a huge success and I am sure my grandson will sort out the lever problem. | Transporter // 5.0 // 6 Dec. 2011 // 3 of 3 people found the following review helpful // Although a little on the expensive side, this truck is very detailed and feels very well made and durable.

I have a couple of dozen or so, including this Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, which my girlfriend gave to me one year as a present. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following in common. They are exacting in the attention to detail, both exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching.I bought my first AutoArt model about five years ago and it still looks as good as the day I opened the packaging. The Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cloth if you're dusting and get damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once .

You can buy a suitable display case for this model, either from Amazon, or else from the MiniModels website.I take great pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home, which now includes a couple of Porsche 911's, a Bugatti Veyron, Koenigsegg CCX, Pagani Huayra, and a couple of Ferrari 599's.

I have a couple of dozen or so, including this Lamborghini, which my girlfriend gave to me one year as a present. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following in common. They are exacting in the attention to detail, both exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching.I bought my first AutoArt model about five years ago and it still looks as good as the day I opened the packaging. The Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cloth if you're dusting and get damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once .

It meant my grandson could have a go at making an Arfix model without us having to also buy glue, paints and brushes, much of which would probably be wasted and cost more than a kit itself. | christmas gift. // 5.0 // 15 Sept. 2013 // By

Even before this lovely concept car became the iconic Batmobile she typified the American luxury cruiser of the time, with fins you could shave on as they say!But back to this model in particular. I am in my fifties and used to watch Batman on TV in the sixties, when this car was as much a star of the show as Adam West.  This model is the largest of the three I have - I only have the small Hot Wheels and Eaglemoss version from the magazine, but this is the most beautiful, she has the racing type steering wheel and even the fire extinguisher in the cab.She has pride of place in my small collection.

The AutoArt models which I own all have the following qualities in common. They are exacting in their attention to detail, both the exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the rubber tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching. The models are quite heavy and need to be handled with care.I bought my first AutoArt model car about six years ago and it still looks as good today as the day I opened the packaging. The one Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cleaning cloth if you're dusting them and get accidentally damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once , with the burgundy coloured and gold wheeled Michael Mann limited edition of the Ferrari 599.The prudent and best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet, keeping it free from dust and finger grease. You can buy a suitable plastic or wooden display case for this model, either here from Amazon, or else from the MiniModels website.I take immense pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home, which now includes a fleet of Porsche 911's, several Bugatti Veyrons, a Koenigsegg CCX, a Pagani Huayra, and very many different types of Lamborghinis and Ferraris.Read more ›",""

I think it is more for the older child - 14 upwards. I bought it for my 8yr old planning to build it together - I've nearly finished all on my own...  The painting gives the final effect of the model and is quite fiddly to get anywhere near perfect. Great that this kit has all the paints, glue and brushes. Ideally the main body of the car needs airbrushing which is more equipment to buy, but not that much if you plan to do other models afterwards. Good fun if you have the patience.

The 2 parts don't even hold well together. My son gets very frustrated with it because the trailer constantly falls away when he's pulling it along.

This version is produced in silver rather than the gold finish of the original model but nonetheless it still features revolving number plates, an ejector seat, bullet proof shield and machine guns etc. evoking memories of the original Corgi model I remember. The quality of the model itself is good, although, the balance that has been struck is making it true to the original model from the 60s rather than updating it, therefore, in some ways it falls short of the level of detail in some of today's models.A couple thousand of the gold versions have also been produced by Corgi but are in short supply and command a significant premium - this version is certainly the next best thing. If it's any consolation the actual car in the Goldfinger movie was silver, but at the time Corgi are said to have thought that if they produced it in silver it might look unfinished, hence the original model being gold.  I can assure you this 2015 silver version of the model certainly looks finished. Recommended. | so glad I got this // 5.0 // 17 Mar. 2015 // By

The baddie and secret instructions are still present in this new version and i love the box, well done Corgi with the little surprise when you pull the model box from the outer package.OK so i'm away to eject the baddie from 007's Aston Martin DB5, activate the machine guns and bring up the bullet-proof shield...",""

I have a couple of dozen or so, including this Lamborghini, which my girlfriend gave to me one year as a present. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following in common. They are exacting in the attention to detail, both exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching.I bought my first AutoArt model about five years ago and it still looks as good as the day I opened the packaging. The Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cloth if you're dusting and get damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once . The best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet, free from dust. You can buy a suitable display case for this model, either from Amazon, or else from the MiniModels website.I take great pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home, which now includes a couple of Porsche 911's, a Bugatti Veyron, Koenigsegg CCX, Pagani Huayra, and a couple of Ferrari 599's. Of all of my collection, I think that the orange coloured Koenigsegg CCX is probably the most stunning, you might want to take a look at one on the MiniModels website if it's not currently available from Amazon.It's always worth price-checking between the Amazon and MiniModels websites, if you're looking to buy a high quality diecast vehicle.Thank you for taking the time to read this review.",""

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 31 Aug. 2013 // This is more a collectors item, than a toy.It arrives in a fairly standard Doctor Who box, albeit quite large.Its packed very well indeed you'll need a small screwdriver and some patience to remove it from its protective box. I prefer this way than rattling around getting broken.You'll also need to feed it 4xAA batteries as they are not included.There is a little assembly required, putting the eye stalk on wasn't the easiest task, don't force it! Once you realise its keyed, think of the keystone of a bridge or window and turn it sideways, it has a long edge on the right, a shorter edge on the left and then draw two lines top and bottom at an angle so they meet up, once you notice that putting the stalk on is much easier, if it fails to light, like mine did, gently push in the springy contacts under the stalk a few times to loosen them after transit and it should light fine.All that was left to do was pop on the plunger and the ray gun, plunger to the left, ray gun to the right It was actually quite easy to put together. I saved the bottom retaining plastic cups and screws and put them back on, as this lets it sit flat on a shelf and raises the wheels up a touch, you can't tell as this all happens under the Daleks black skirt  but keeps it from rolling off on its own to explore the universe There are 8 recorded dalek phrases, all in high quality, the head lights  flash white when it speaks and when turned on the blue led in the eye stalk glows for up to 30 mins at a time.You activate the sound by pressing one of the bumps on the dalek at the front.Read more › | Stunning. // 5.0 // 5 Sept. 2013 // By

 on 20 Aug. 2013 // Exactly as I expected and super fast delivery with Prime, this Union Jack Dalek is the perfect way to remember what will be one of the show's biggest years. It's much larger than I imagined and highly detailed with accurate paint application. A few nicks here and there on the paint job but apart from that fine. Requires 4 AA batteries which aren't included to power the lights and sounds - there's 8 Dalek catch phrases it can play.It features moving gun arm and sucker as well as eye stalk and head. Also, to my surprise, you can also twist the middle section too allowing for it to be put into many different poses for display. It also has wheels on the bottom for if you wanted it to be more of a toy - but it's cool enough to look great on a shelf! Perfect for any WHO fan! A reminder than the greatest show on Earth is BRITISH! This Dalek is a true British icon and you'll love it!This figure is described as 'push along', it is NOT remote control. Also, by ""limited edition"" they mean these will only be sold this year, there isn't a limited amount of stock. | Husbands Christmas Pressie // 4.0 // 9 Jan. 2014 // By

The only down side is the fact it does not move like the other remote controlled daleks he has, although it does speak.  However he loved the fact it was a special edition for 2013. | Very good!

 on 6 Oct. 2013 // Overall, this product is a must have for any serious Doctor Who collector, it's priced roughly the same price as an r/c Dalek but this doesn't have that feature. The Dalek itself is pretty much the same size as the older style R/C Daleks and has the mid section that can rotate. Because this Dalek has no R/C function it is very much lighter than the other types out there. The speech is spot on and the lights are always fun to see going off. Unfortunately I wanted to give the product 5 stars but their are a couple of points I wanted to point out. The Union Jack design looks fantastic on the front however only on the front is it show, for me personally it would've been a bigger incentive to have the design going all the way to the back making it complete instead of it just cutting off suddenly. The biggest but however as to be the packaging - I trade on ebay and know how important it is to securely pack items but this product goes over the top with secure packing. EVERYTHING is either bolted down with nails which are difficult to get out especially since a black cover has been placed over the top of the nails. OR been locked with the plastic twists and then at least 3 layers of sellotape stuck over them. So be prepared for that long thin screwdrivers, scissors and a lot of patience is required to get this Dalek out of the box.Overall, this product is a very good purchase but as they say, nothing's perfect, just the 'half finished' flag and unpacking let this down slightly. | Cool Dalek, annoying packaging // 5.0 // 8 Jan. 2014 // By

 on 8 Jan. 2014 // The Dalek looks and sounds great - it's a worthy 50th Anniversay collector's piece.The one caveat I have concerns the excessive  packaging, which is fiddly to remove, as others have detailed.Most annoying is the fact that it requires the use of a tiny screwdriver in order to remove the Dalek from its base. If you don't have one to hand, you're snookered.While the plunger and weapon arm are easy to attach, the eye stalk is not so straight-forward. It took several attempts to get the electircal contacts aligned correctly so the eye could attach. Why it wasn't pre-attached is beyond me, it should have beenTo access the battery compartment requires further use of a very small screwdriver. The Dalek requires four AA batteries  in order to power the speech and light functions. There is also a separete on/off switch on the base that needs setting to the correct position if these functions are to work.If you're buying the Dalek as a present for a child make sure you also buy batteries and have a small screwdriver to hand - I used the one I got from the opticians to tighten my glesses.Once it's out of the packaging, assembled and powered-up, the Dalek looks and sounds great, but it is undoubtedly somewhat of a hassle getting to this point.Dalek 5 out of 5Packaging 0 out of 5",""
